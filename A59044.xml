            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our offence and anger, begot this Treatiſe: And therefore it is <hi>yours;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for you: Not only to remove the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but to inſtruct you, into a way of peace and love: Your <hi>anger</hi> was the <hi>Father</hi> of it; but <hi>love</hi> conceived it, and is its <hi>Mother:</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begotten of <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> you may well expect both natures in it: And muſt receive them both together,
<pb facs="tcp:41851:3"/>for they cannot be ſeparated. <hi>Severity and kindneſs, are one in their Original and End:</hi> They meet, in the preſent Providence of God upon you: They are bound up together in this little vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume: If your minds be as large as it, or in any meaſure, ſuitable to your preſent condition, you will eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and digeſt both: If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree with ſome ſharpneſs; you will neither agree with your ſelves, nor with God: For you have been, and are ſo, to others; and God is now ſo to you.</p>
            <p>I write both <hi>againſt</hi> and <hi>for</hi> all: Againſt and for my <hi>ſelf:</hi> Againſt and for <hi>you:</hi> And againſt and for your <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries:</hi> Becauſe there is ſome good, and evil in all: My quarrel is only at <hi>malice,</hi> which makes all the quarrels in the earth: And at that, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes: If I meet with any, in that way of enmity and deſtruction, I do not forbear them: You will, I hope, find in the reading of it, that the root
<pb facs="tcp:41851:3"/>and ſpring of it is <hi>love;</hi> the deſign of it, in all the parts of it, is to <hi>unite</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Parties; and the concluſion is <hi>peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would gladly that you ſhould have the honour, of being the firſt movers in, and ſeekers of peace: Your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel and Kingdom of peace, ſhould incline you to it: You have proved war, and it at laſt fails you: Your preſent ſufferings preſs you, to meekneſs and patience: It is to me evident, and in this Book, I think de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated; that thoſe good things you expected by war, you can obtain and inherit, only by love and peace, and in the good ſpirit of Jeſus: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have endeavoured to ſearch the roots of your ſtate and ſtanding in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as deeply as I can: that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlain, you may be free, to go forth from your preſent captivity, into largeneſs: and ſo into peace and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
            <p>There are two things which I ſuſpect
<pb facs="tcp:41851:4"/>may deny you the benefit of what I have written.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I doubt the things here writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, may not, at leaſt not in all parts, be fully and clearly underſtood: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my mind having long travelled, in the purſuit of the reaſon and principles of things, lies at ſome diſtance, from mens ordinary apprehenſions of things; and therefore may not be ſo readily conceived: I am ſenſible alſo, that by reaſon of my long retirement, there is a cloud upon my ſpirit, that I cannot yet come forth, with that evidence, that I would, and I believe ſhall: I know likewiſe, that mens underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, live much abroad, in outward things, and are little converſant with the inward reaſon and ſpirit of things: And that at this time, your minds are like troubled waters, diſturbed and not clear.</p>
            <p>To remedy theſe defects, both in your ſelves and me, let me prevail with you, to read this ſmall Treatiſe, with a
<pb facs="tcp:41851:4"/>little more then ordinary diligence and conſideration.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible of the obſcurity of the former Book, which made it ſo liable to miſtakes: And have endeavoured all plainneſs here, even to courſneſs, and have taken liberty, rather to write the ſame things again, then to be too ſhort: Yet I doubt ſome parts of it may be vail'd to thee: If thou meet with any places that are ſo; Poſſibly the greateſt treaſure of truth may lie hid there: True wiſdom yet lies deep, and is hardly found, hardly expreſſed, and hardly underſtood: If thou wilt dig for her, by a little ſtudy, ſhe will reward thy pains: If therefore there be a curtain drawn, before any part, do but rouſe up thy reaſon, and preſs in upon it, you may have admittance, by a little conſideration and labour.</p>
            <p>My ſecond doubt is, leſt you meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſomething, that may croſs your opinion of your ſelves and way; you ſhould turn away from the juſtice
<pb facs="tcp:41851:5"/>and truth of reproof: But conſider, if you will hear nothing againſt you, you can never come to know your faults: If you will receive nothing, but what agrees with your preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, you muſt reſolve never to be wiſer: If thou meeteſt with a ſtrange, different, or oppoſite notion to thine own, conſider; it is either true, or falſe: If it be true, then it is a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing for thy ſoul, to refuſe a truth, and embrace a lie: For no man can be happy but in truth: If it be falſe, do but throughly examine it, and thou wilt find the falſhood of it; and then it will be a great confirmation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement to truth in thy mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: Therefore turn not from it, nor reject it; but rather ſearch it and ſubdue it: For no <hi>lie</hi> can long ſtand out, againſt a <hi>true mind:</hi> If an errour have gotten ſome ſhew of reaſon, or truth, to cover it; if it be, by a juſt mind ſearched and tried; that reaſon and truth, will come over, to that juſt mind, and leave
<pb facs="tcp:41851:5"/>the lie naked and deſtitute; ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts are very much to the advantage of truth: The experience I have of this thing, makes me love the exerciſe of oppoſition; and to delight to read, above all things, thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my judgement: For I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly find, that things ſaid and done againſt the truth, do as our Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his Diſciples: <hi>It ſhall turn unto you for a teſtimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know and feel that ſore travel is upon you; <hi>pangs have taken hold of you:</hi> It is, that you may be born again, into a new ſtate and life, more holy, large, merciful, and heavenly, then that wherein you have lived and acted: It is that, I labour with you for, in this Treatiſe: If you could once come to underſtand this deſign of God, in his preſent afflicting of you: That it is not to upbraid, much leſs to deſtroy, the Party or your perſons, for your or others perſonal ſins; no, he pitties and forgives: But it is that carnal and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſtate, of war, enmity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying,
<pb facs="tcp:41851:6"/>that is accurſed of God: If you could but diſcern this; and turn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> away from that fleſhly, corrupted, and now periſhed ſtate; you would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find eaſe, reſt and ſafety for your ſouls; and eſcape much of the guilt and curſe that yet ſorely afflicts you: It is the intent of this Treatiſe, to bring you off from that; and to ſhew you <hi>a more excellent way.</hi> Your former miniſtry is finiſhed, that ſtate is periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; you muſt have a new one: Read diligently, and you will find, here is an entrance into that, which will not fail.</p>
            <p>I know the prejudices you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; I know that there is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in what I write; both may diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage my work: I leave it to the Lord of all hearts and ſpirits: The things I have written, are I think juſt; and it is juſt I ſhould publiſh them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Law of love and truth, in my mind, led me to it, and upheld me in it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am ſatisfied in my ſelf: And in the righteouſneſs truth, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, in whom I live and reſt,</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat I did deny my name, to go forth with that Book, when it was firſt publiſhed, was I think, a fooliſh or weak niceneſs? Poſſibly the want of that courage and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that was due, both to my ſelf and it, may expoſe both to the greater contempt:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41851:9"/>But I did reſolve in my mind, and promiſe, that if ever it came to be queſtioned, I would own it; and either correct and amend it, if it needed; or elſe juſtifie and defend it, if it deſerved it. What I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is ordinarily required of me; and if it be, I am bound to perform it: <hi>There is a juſtice due to things, as well as to perſons:</hi> If to any thing, then certainly to a mans own works, which are his children, and therefore he ought to Father them; and either to call them home, or maintain them abroad.</p>
               <p>A mans Spirit, Religion and Name, are all tender things; if I have any ſenſe of any of them, or of my ſelf, and what I have done, I cannot but reſent the <hi>grievous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> that is taken at that book, and at me for writing of it: The minds of many are exceedingly diſturbed at it; and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures run as high againſt it, and me, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they can: It is judged, the very Spirit of Antichriſt, and of the Devil, the ſin againſt the Holy-Ghoſt, Apoſtacy, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, Treachery, Bloodineſs and Cruelty: And the condemnation is anſwerable, the curſe of horrour, deſpair, and ſelf-deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; which are not only threatned, and expected, but reported to be already upon me.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41851:9"/>
               <p>Theſe things are in their own nature weighty, and they come thick upon me, from all ſects and ſorts of people; from friends and ſtrangers; and diſcharged at me, from their very hearts, with all the ſtrength of their Religion, with all their might; in a bitter and angry Spirit, ſharp and fierce; and in ſome with great ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gravity; yea in love to me: And moſt of them ſolemnly in the name of God, and for his cauſe; as againſt an enemy to God, to godlineſs, and to his people: This is the ſenſe I have of them, and I think the deſcription is juſt and true: Theſe things being <hi>breathed forth</hi> from men, friends, Chriſtians profeſſing godlineſs and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God: beſides the common rage that foames out, Rogue, Jeſuite, hang him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They do requite and juſtly challenge from me, that I ſhould Animadvert, and duly conſider what theſe things are? whence they come? What they would have? and what I am, and have done to deſerve them?</p>
               <p>As theſe things drive me in to review both my ſelf and book; ſo they do peal and call me forth, to ſhew in what Spirit and Light I live; from what root this work came, and upon what foundation, that and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41851:10"/>my ſelf ſtand; ſo that I now count my ſelf bound, not only in honour and juſtice, but in love, freely to open and diſcover my ſelf, and my mind and ſpirit, concerning my ſelf, my book, and the great offence taken at it.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, I do feel that theſe cenſures are high, and that men are hearty and ſerious in them, and do lay them on with all their ſtrength, and with a ſharp ſpirit, angred and provoked: And that they do ſometimes ſting and twinge a little, and conſequently ſtir ſome choler in me, that I could be as heartily angry at others, as others are at me: But as yet I do not find that they go deep, or abide long in me: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I have been well able to bear them; yea to ſlight and neglect them, as ſick and ſore paſſions, which cannot live long; and although they ſtumble at me, and bruiſe me, yet if I did but lie ſtill, I ſhould quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee them faln in their own dirt, by their own darkneſs and weakneſs: <hi>For that I find conſtantly to be the nature of Paſſion, it is a blind thing that runs it ſelf into ruin, and needs no enemy to deſtroy it:</hi> it is the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder of the mind, while it is ſhot at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it doth crack, ſtink and vaniſh.</p>
               <p>As I muſt confeſs they do ſometimes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41851:10"/>ſting a little; ſo I muſt profeſs that hitherto they have not only been tolerable and eaſie to bear, but that I have had pleaſure in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them: I ſhall honeſtly diſcover the reaſon of it to you; in juſtice to truth, and in love to you; that you may hereafter learn, better to bear the reproofs that either I, or others ſhall charge upon you; if you do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed find the ſame cauſe in you.</p>
               <p>What ever infirmities are either in my ſelf, or the Book; I know moſt certainly, and feel, that I am not that, which I am judged to be: or if I am all that, I am alſo ſomething elſe, that ſupports me under it; elſe I could not live: I know aſſuredly, that there is both Truth, Reaſon, Love and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in me, and in what I have written, however it is vailed, and therefore people are much miſtaken in me: Learn this then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Truth, Love and Innocency, have a conſtant peace in them, that none can take from them; When under infirmity, and under Judgements and Trials for infirmity, they have then a ſingular and ſpecial luſtre, and brightneſs in them, and an anſwerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency: For he that indeed enjoyes theſe things, knows that he hath a royalty within himſelf, an autarchie, content and ſelf-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41851:11"/>And not only ſufficient to bear, but an abſolute and ſupream authority, by which he can deliver himſelf from the judgement of others, as weak, remote and ignorant, and can juſtifie himſelf: Truth knowing its own ſufficiency, ability and authority, to deliver it ſelf both from its own weakneſs and others miſtakes, ſecretly triumphs, &amp; is well pleaſed to lie down under, and to riſe up out of obſcurity:</hi> Theſe things I diſcover to you, as my preſent and conſtant experience, knowing that you have great need of them in this day of your rebuke: if you have them not, ſearch for them; they will be far better then ſtriving with, or victory over enemies.</p>
               <p>I was for ſome time paſſive and quiet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe hard cenſures, and much more at reſt in my mind ſince I writ the Book, then before: Be it good or bad, be the miſtakes in it, or concerning it, what they will; I am thus far well ſatisfied, as to my ſelf, it is better out then in. It was a burden to me, while it was in me, and an eaſe to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it.</p>
               <p>Being quiet and ſtill under his ſtorm, I was at work about another piece; drawing a line of Hiſtory, Divine and Spiritual, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Rational, Scriptural and Literal, of Church and Kingdom, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41851:11"/>of both unto this day: Wherein I found great content; ſeeing that the ſtate of the Church now under Controverſie; and the things that I had produced, now the matter of offence, had ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ground, in the Divine and Eternal Law of God, in the Reaſon and Nature of man, and in the letter of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>That there are theſe three diſtinct Laws, I think no man queſtions; and that theſe three do perfectly agree, is as generally confeſſed: For the Divine and Eternal Law or mind of God, hath imprinted his own image upon man: And therefore the true reaſon or underſtanding of man, muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to its Original, the mind of God: The ſame God hath expreſſed: he ſame mind in his written Word: And therefore the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word muſt agree both to the mind of God that declared it, and to the true reaſon of man, that is formed by the ſame Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; and they cannot but all anſwer to each other.</p>
               <p>If theſe three agree, and are united and brought together by Chriſt, as certainly they are; for all three meet in him, and come ſorth together from him: Then if we truly underſtand one, we ſhall underſtand all: And that which is truly ſpiritual, or the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41851:12"/>mind of God, is alſo moſt Rational: and that which is Spiritual and Rational, is alſo Scriptural, or according to the written Word: And it is as true on the contrary, that what pretends to be Spiritual, and is not alſo Rational, is not of the <hi>man Chriſt,</hi> but is a <hi>ſpiritual beaſt:</hi> And what ſeems Rational, and is not alſo Spiritual, that doth not derive it ſelf from the <hi>heavenly man,</hi> it is <hi>earthly</hi> and <hi>ſenſual</hi> at leaſt: And what men have from the Scriptures only, and not from the heavenly pattern, muſt needs be a broken reed, not fit to meaſure any thing: For the heavenly mind, which gave forth the Scriptures, can only interpret them; and what is Spiritual and Scriptural, will be alſo Rational.</p>
               <p>Therefore theſe two things do neceſſarily follow. Firſt, That no man can juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be received in the Church, or to be believed in what he affirms, if he do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate what he brings, from all theſe three: becauſe the Church is the body of Chriſt, and partakes of Chriſts nature: if theſe three agree in him, ſhe cannot ſubject to any thing rightly, but what hath the Light of all three in it: Neither can there be any demonſtration made of any thing in Religion, but from the firſt and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41851:12"/>higheſt of theſe, into the two lower. And ſecondly, That which hath the joint teſtimony of all theſe, may challenge belief from all men and Chriſtians, and from the whole Church: And it were great breach of Charity and Truſt, to doubt the ſucceſs of Truth ſo delivered to the Church.</p>
               <p>And therefore I was not a little pleaſed, to find that I had ſo much light with me, as to eſſay ſuch a thing and to ſatisfie my reaſon, that it was poſſible for me to do it: Not doubting, but if I could attain it, I ſhould not only enlighten and ſatisfie my offended Brethren, but bring forth that which might heal and reſtore the Church of God, by leading of her up, to her own head and heavenly pattern; whereby only ſhe can be cured, purged, juſtified and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</p>
               <p>I do deſire by the way, that men would take notice of this, That what I have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenly and briefly hinted in that Book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a National Church, the right of Kings and Biſhops in the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you judge of them, that they are now ſtarted up from the baſeſt and vileſt ſpirit of time-ſerving for preferment: yet I do affirm to you, whatever weakneſs doth attend the manner of expreſſing of them: that they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41851:13"/>are from the <hi>holy Mount;</hi> from the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and divine Law; thence I received them, how ever I may miſ-repreſent them; and that not of late; twelve years ſince I writ and publiſhed the ſame things: and they have continued in the inward frame of my mind, through many and ſore ſpiritual tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, ever ſince, without any change.</p>
               <p>This being plainly, and honeſtly affirmed to you, and upon the review of my ſelf and mind, occaſioned by your rebukes: I may expect from you, ſo much friendly and Chriſtian ingenuity, that you would not ſo ſcornfully reject them, to throw them away, as not worthy to be read; but that you would read them, with that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs and conſideration, that is due to things that come under ſuch a name, and profeſs ſuch an original.</p>
               <p>I was interrupted in this work, thus, having written ſome part of it, I offered it to the Preſs, by the Book-ſeller that printed the <hi>Inquiſition:</hi> Upon conſideration he told me, that there was that rage kindled in mens minds againſt the <hi>other Book,</hi> that his men durſt not ſhew them in the ſhop; and that nothing of mine would paſs till that ſpirit was laid, and therefore he durſt not meddle with this to print it.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41851:13"/>
               <p>My mind being very weak and tender, and apt to take check at ſuch things; this did not only put me to a ſtand, but turned my mind quite about, to hearken more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to this cry that did thus earneſtly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue me: And to conſider, that ſure this mouth, that was thus opened againſt me, did require ſomething of me: And that I could not fairly, nor juſtly ſlight and neglect it any longer: And that I could not proceed in my intended work, till I had anſwered this plea againſt me.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>SECT. II.</head>
               <p>TIS a poſition in my mind, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or things, that we converſe with, are abſolutely evil; but there is ſome good in every thing, elſe it could not be: and therefore nothing is to be reprobated, or not, till it be firſt ſifted and tried. By my own rule, I am bound to think, that though theſe angry ſpeeches againſt me, are my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet ſure there is ſome juſt reaſon in them: ſuch ſounds at theſe, are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ſignificancy. If ſo, then I muſt not reject them, becauſe oppoſite and unpleaſing, but muſt admit them to the bar of my own
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41851:14"/>reaſon: and not only give them a fair hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but all the advantage alſo that I can; becauſe the Court is my own mind, where they are ſtrangers; and being weak diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered things, I ought to humble my ſelf to them, though mine enemies, and to deſcend from my own right, to hear and ſatisfie them if I can, or at leaſt to do them juſtice: For I conſider, though they be dark paſſions, yet they are humane: and every man is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and every affection in man, though ſick and diſtempered, is of value; beſides they are zealous, ſerious, brethren, friends, Chriſtians: therefore I muſt query: Have I not erred againſt them? have I not done them wrong? have I not detained ſomething from them, that is their due? We have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed a <hi>Kingdom of Heaven within us:</hi> if it be there indeed, then we have in us a throne of judgement: which muſt do right to all things, that come before us. In this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, there is alſo ſufficient, to anſwer every plea, and claim, that is made to it, or againſt it; and therefore we need not fear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the greateſt and ſtrongeſt accuſation to a full and fair hearing.</p>
               <p>Where there is authority to judge, and ſufficiency to anſwer, there is likewiſe wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to underſtand, what there is in theſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41851:14"/>clamours, though they be of themſelves very dark and confuſed things: for the mind may taſte and try all things throughly; and every thing that comes into it, muſt be opened, and ſeen in that light that is in it; becauſe the mind is a ſupream light, to which all things are ſubject, that come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſetting my ſelf to examine and conſider theſe things, I found firſt, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there was juſt reaſon in the book, yet there was ſomething, that hindered men from the ſeeing of it: and though there was love and good in it, yet there was ſomething alſo, that denyed men the benefit of it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tis righteous that it ſhould be animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and endure a tryal.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, I find that there is ſome thing in my ſelf, that is juſtly due, both to my friends, and brethren, and to the Book it ſelf: that was not therein communicated: which is my life and ſpirit; the ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I ſtand: upon which I wrote, and by which I am enabled to aſſert things ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from others. As theſe high challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of my ſpirit and peace, do tell me, that this is the thing wanting, and now demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of me: ſo I am upon this review of things, conſcious to my ſelf, that I have not fully
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41851:15"/>opened my ſelf, and my mind: but have in a great meaſure concealed it, as well as my name.</p>
               <p>And therefore I muſt thus far juſtifie the plea againſt me: That if a man bring forth a notion of things, different from, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the life of others: they may juſtly refuſe that notion: if the Author do not bring forth his own life, ſpirit, and peace: which only can maintain thoſe notions: and ſatisfie for that life, that he would take away by thoſe notions. This is for you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope you will well obſerve the juſtice of it. I am content to condemn what I have done, as guilty of this capital offence: It may poſſibly ſtand as a Law to me and others hereafter: That if any man write, be it never ſo good reaſon, and with good intention; if he do not produce the <hi>head</hi> of the ſpring, from whence it comes, and his own heart, ſoul, and peace with it: let it wither and be rejected; truly I believe it will.</p>
               <p>There is a further juſtice in the perſons offended. If any man utter his matters to his friends, and conceal himſelf, he deals injuriouſly with them: in bringing forth the weaker and worſe, and hiding the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part; which the royal Law of love will
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41851:15"/>condemn, as a great wrong: for certainly if there be any thing worthy in a man, tis his ſpiritual life: and therefore I juſtifie your anger, you do like friends and men; not to take words, notions, and reaſon, if there be a better thing in me: your own life and peace, being aimed at; you may well chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge me, to ſhew a better: I have this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief againſt this charge: that though I am guilty, in not diſcovering the beſt, yet the beſt is ſtill with me, and being my own as yet, it will ſupport and juſtifie me.</p>
               <p>Neither can I complain juſtly of any injury done to me by theſe ſharp cenſures: for if any man will put on an appearance, ſtrange to his neighbours, and withal cover his face; tis no wonder if men beat him, and the dogs bark at him: if he be ill uſed, he may thank himſelf, and his covering: There is this remedy alſo, if hiding the life and face, be the fault, that enmity that is occaſioned by it, will rend that vayl, and then the quarrel will be ended.</p>
               <p>If I have a right ſenſe of the offence that is againſt me, (it being at me, and upon me, it ſure belongs to me to feel and underſtand it) then I am called forth to give a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Book, and to hold forth to the view of all the world, my ſpirit and life
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41851:16"/>from whence it came; and to ſhew what righteouſneſs and power is with me, that can maintain me, and others, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and practiſing ſuch things as I have writ.</p>
               <p>I have been very inward, and retired in my ſpirit a long time; not without ſome motions to look out; but I have ſuppreſſed them; and till now declined all publick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. Being ſenſible that my mind is both weak, and a great ſtranger to all the Forms and ways of Religion that are abroad; and having found by experience, that when I did look out, I met with great trouble and oppoſition, from all ſorts of people: I have been willing to enjoy my peace and comfort at home, and alone. I did the leaſt think to come forth in oppoſition to any party, having in my heart a general love to all men; But I am by this Book, unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly engaged to come forth in ſome kind of oppoſition to many, if not all ſorts of ſpirits, now ſtirring in the Nation.</p>
               <p>The people that have ſeverely cenſured this book and me for it, are Independents, Anabaptiſts, Quakers, Fifth monarchy men, and ſuch as profeſs themſelves ſpiritual, and are in no particular form; I deſire them all friendly to conſider, how high they have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41851:16"/>raiſed the controverſie, and what muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be the iſſue, if it be determined: If any of them had taken the book, and dealt with the reaſon of it: and had anſwered it, and convinced me; I had been bound to have been their Scholler, and to have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to them as my Maſter: And if my reaſon had been too good for theirs, I might have expected the ſame from them, and no more: But they all leaving the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and falling directly upon my perſon, and the ſtate of my ſoul, my life and peace; the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar is like to be of a higher nature; and the queſtion, who is the Antichriſt? who the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate? who hath ſinned againſt the Holy Spirit? and conſequently who muſt go down into horror and trouble, into Satan, and the diſpleaſure of God? and ſo it is a war of ſouls and ſpirits about the moſt ſolemn things of life and peace with God.</p>
               <p>And therefore the iſſue muſt be this: if you ſubdue me, and overthrow my ſtate, I muſt bow, and ſeek for mercy and peace of you, upon ſuch conditions, as you ſhall think good to give it: This I know you do expect: and as neceſſarily I muſt, ſo I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I readily ſhall perform it: on the other ſide, if my ſtate and peace be good, and yours fail; I may require the ſame of you, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41851:17"/>you ſhould ſubmit to me, and accept of my peace and pardon, according to that equal and juſt Law, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do earneſtly deſire, that we may on both ſides heartily engage in this quarrel: if I find you do ſhrink from it, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to compell you to ſtand to it, till there be a compleat victory gained by one of us: If you be men, and true to any thing that you ſay or think, you cannot avoid the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; for I know and feel, that you are come forth againſt me, in your cenſures of me, with all your hearts, and with the ſtrength of your God, Religion, and Life: as againſt an enemy to God and his cauſe; tis ſo evident it cannot be denyed: And by it you have drawn forth my life and ſpirit, (which till now lay cloſe and ſtill) to anſwer you; and therefore you are bound to ſtand and abide the diſpute: This I write neither lightly, boaſtingly, nor threatning, but ſoberly and ſeriouſly, in love to you, and to the good and peace of ſouls.</p>
               <p>The combat may be ſharp, but it may be friendly alſo: For I do conſtantly find this truth in my mind: that as all good doth, and will overcome evil, becauſe it is larger, ſtronger, truer, and more durable then evil:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41851:17"/>ſo doth love conquer, &amp; ſwallow up enmity; enmity is a mean, inferiour, baſe thing, that is but a ſervant to the greatneſs and maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of love. And at this time, I find a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love, both of pitty and friendſhip, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and ſtirred in my heart, by theſe wounds that you have given me: For I feel ſuch a nature in me, the more you pierce, the more freely my love and life will flow forth to you; ſo that there is a ring of love made for us, in which we may ſafely try our ſtrength: and therefore, though it be both a ſerious and ſharp conteſt, yet it muſt alſo be a friendly ſtrife: It may be, love hath laid a train to catch us all, and all the enmity of all men: For obſerve our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, it is of a very high nature, for no leſs then the life and peace of our ſouls; yet if we fight it out, the end will be this: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I muſt return to you, and receive mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from you; of you muſt come to me, and receive it from me: Either you muſt be my Paſtors or Miniſters, and ſo heal and feed me, as a brother: or I your Biſhop and Father. The quarrell is, Whether you ſhall ſerve me, with your life; or I ſerve you with mine? Whether I ſhall forgive you, or you forgive me? Poſſibly after ſome anger ſpent in the conflict, it may be comprimiſed, and we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41851:18"/>may both have our ends, both ſerve and be ſerved, forgive and be forgiven: But let us reſolve to try it out: for if you draw back and refuſe the combat, you will go down into your dark holes of enmity; but preſs forward, and we ſhall certainly come to feel and underſtand one another, though through ſome ſmart: and at laſt after we have ſpent our heat, end in love.</p>
               <p>If we had dealt in opinions that concern the State, you might have feared trouble: but you ſhall have the ſtate of my mind to deal with: which you may do, without danger of any ſuffering, but in your ſpirits: our war will be now purely in and about ſpiritual things: If we ſhould controvert National Church, Epiſcopacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the power of the Nation might be with me: but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining that as you do, and dealing only with my ſpirit and life: poſſibly the Biſhops may be as different from me, and from my ſpirit and life, as you are: yea, and be more with you, then they are with me; and I am apt to think it may prove ſo: How ever you may be confident, you are free from, outward danger, in dealing with the ſpirit of a private perſon.</p>
               <p>You have advantage, enough: you are many: I am alone: you are whole and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41851:18"/>ſound; I am I confeſs, much broken and weak: you ſtand firm, I have been toſſed about: my infirmities and failings are many, and viſible to all the world; and moſt of all to my ſelf: yet truly I do deſire and ſhall endeavour a fair trial, not doubting the iſſue; which way ſoever it fall, it muſt be good.</p>

               <head>SECT. III.</head>
               <p>FIrſt for the Book, I have had many complaints againſt it, but only in general, as a monſtrous, ſtrange, wicked, and curſed thing: I have invited many to ſhew me par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, what falſe or unrighteous propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions there are in it: and to this day not one man hath ſaid to me, that this or that ſentence is untrue, or will give me any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt any paſſage of it: But when we come to the point, either they have not read it, or but part of it; or I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it; or What do you mean by this or that paſſage? Tis ſtrange, totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned but not examined in any parts of it; I may ſay in my caſe, as <hi>Job, chap.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 35, 36, 37. <hi>That mine adverſary had written a Book; ſurely I would take it upon my ſhoulder,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41851:19"/>and bind it as a crown to me: I would declare to him the number of my ſteps, &amp;c.</hi> Had his reproofs been heavy, true or falſe, I would have taken them upon my ſhoulder, and born either my own, or his infirmities: I have done it, and by the ſame grace of God, I can do it again: Or had his book been more true, righteous or mercifull then mine; I can boldly ſay, I ſhould have put it upon my head, openly worn his underſtanding, profeſſed it, and gloried in it, as a crown. I know I have in me, that authority over my ſelf, and have been ſo converſant in ſelf-judging, and retracting what I have ſeen to be ſhort, and alſo ſuch a love to truth, that it would be a glory and crown to me, to meet with a light, that could convince mine of darkneſs: yea I have this experience of my ſelf, I can prefer another before me, and give <hi>honour,</hi> time, and place to my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, even when I know they are the <hi>weaker.</hi> But I may and do think, that men are not able to deal with the reaſon of the Book; and therefore it is left to my ſelf, to Animadvert upon it: and poſſibly I may deal as ſeverely with it as another.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that I blame the book for, is its untimelineſs, it came too late. I have in my heart a love to manknid, to all Engliſh
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41851:19"/>men, and to the oppoſite parties in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: my place and work is to heal, unite and reconcile: and ſo to prevent ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; if I might be heard, none ſhould execute it, nor any ſuffer it. Many things did offer themſelves in my mind, that did tend to a univerſal peace, and a compoſing all differences, to the great advantage of the whole, and of every part; They have been long conceived in my mind: and did offer themſelves to birth, at the beginning of this great change: but I delaid ſo long, till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirit had ſtepped in, and engaged the minds of men, both in doing, and ſuffering: ſo that what was propoſed towards mother courſe, could not be heard by either; and for this I ſuffered a very ſharp rebuke from the Lord, before the Book came forth: twas like that to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 4.24. <hi>God met him and ſought to kill him.</hi> A more dangerous aſſault I have not received a long time, nor a de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>per wound: I have ſtill a frequent ſenſe of it, which keeps me in an awe of God.</p>
               <p>My evil was ſuppreſſing a that light of love and peace, which did ariſe in my mind from the divine nature; This we muſt know, and I declare it from a living ſenſe; That <hi>God is in his nature, moſt gracious, tender, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41851:20"/>yet he knows how to take vengeance on all iniquity, even in his deareſt children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where there is the greateſt love, there is the greateſt authority and majeſty, yea the greateſt jealouſie and ſeverity: I find it ſo in his conſtant dealings with me.</p>
               <p>The ſupreme Law of God, is <hi>himſelf, Love;</hi> and with it peace, ſalvation, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, good-will to man: The very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Law of this love is, to do good, and communicate: none receives it for himſelf only, but to give forth to others; of all things it muſt not be confined nor impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, being in its own nature infinitely large: <hi>You have freely received, freely give.</hi> If this be the higheſt Law, it doth puniſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; being offended, or tranſgreſſed againſt, it requires the ſoreſt puniſhment, which is, to take away that love: They that have felt love, muſt needs have the ſharpeſt ſenſe of the want of it: and its nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large and communicating: that <hi>evil ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that hides and buries this talent</hi> of love and peace, and not communicate it; it ſhall be taken from him: This was my danger.</p>
               <p>All men live under a Law: the Law of love is the exacteſt and ſevereſt, where it is in life and power: or the Law of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life which is in Jeſus: it is there the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41851:20"/>quickeſt and ſharpeſt; and works moſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrongly, where it is engraven and written upon the heart, and put in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts:</hi> Every ſtroke of a Law of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, in the moſt inward parts muſt needs be terrible, threatning eternal death. I write this not only that you may know, that I live under a Law and exact diſcipline: but that all may learn <hi>to fear the Lord and his goodneſs:</hi> For know aſſuredly that God will be known and feared of all, and that in great mercy and ſeverity; For his love and grace, where it is in its truth and power, will not be abuſed, and turned into looſeneſs and wantonneſs: you may abuſe and corrupt leſſer favour, but it will riſe and be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at laſt have that abſoluteneſs in it, that it will rule, and give Law to us: elſe it cannot ſave us.</p>
               <p>My ſuppreſſing the movings of general and healing love, was thus: it often roſe up in my mind, and required to be written and publiſhed; I did attempt and eſſay to do it: but what I did one day, I diſliked the ſecond or third day: either from the weakneſs of my mind, or from a growing ſpring of light, or both: but finding larger and deeper diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I refuſed and rejected the former: and ſo in hope of doing better, more ſtrongly,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41851:21"/>more certainly and completely; I delayed to do what was preſent, till the ſeaſon was paſt.</p>
               <p>There is in this a great evil, for which I received a great rebuke, and yet am I not wholly delivered from the ſnare: for the further enlargement of my mind, and the inſtruction of others, I will examine the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of it.</p>
               <p>In not giving forth truth, light and love, as it ariſes naturally in our minds, but defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring till it be more accompliſhed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; or till we can give it a finer dreſs, which may render it the more acceptable to others, that ſo the fruit may be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and our ſelves more honoured and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified: In this there is a great tranſgreſſion againſt the Law of love and life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is a fin againſt that truth or light; an undervaluing of it, as if it were not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ſeen and looked upon by men in its own natural form, wherein there is the greateſt beauty; it is ſufficiently, if not moſt lovely, in it ſelf, and in its own naked and native goodneſs: All light hath a natural Majeſtie in it, and is beſt when pureſt and unmixed; it commands by its own bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but above all, the light of love is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and perfect: It hath in it a ſufficiency
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41851:21"/>of glory, to take away the ſpots and defects of other things: and therefore it ſelf needs no accompliſhments: All additions to light and love, do darken and ecclipſe them both: for they give beauty and glory to all, and receive from none.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is a ſin againſt God, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of him, not to commit our ſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the leadings of his ſpirit: it is an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his preſence with, and dominion over every ſpirit: he being in and over all men, he will plead the cauſe of Truth with them, eſpecially when it riſes ſimply and purely from himſelf, and his own good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And will make it effectual to that end that he ſends it: It is moſt righteouſly due to him, that he ſhould have the managing, of what light and grace he gives to any man: and to employ it to his own holy ends and purpoſes; to be a <hi>ſavour of life,</hi> or <hi>of death,</hi> as he pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is in it, want of love to Brethren: for why ſhould we be either afraid or aſhamed to appear to them we love juſt as we are? if I love my neighbour as my ſelf, why ſhould not I appear to him as I do to my ſelf? and be confident of him, that if I be found weak to him, he will both pitty, cover, and help me, as I would do to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41851:22"/>my ſelf, or as I would do to him: Sure ſuch confidence and openneſs of heart, one to another, will ſooner gain entrance into the heart, then formal and neat diſcourſes into the head, being moſt natural and familiar: And if they obtain a place in the heart, they will effect more, then by pleaſing the fancy: yea weakneſs as well as confidence ſuits beſt, with them that are weak: A man may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power a weak mind, by too great an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſtrength of Reaſon: We are all weak; if any will ſeem to be otherwiſe, I doubt he doth but diſſemble, and get a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering; but if any could attain a perfection, he would by it, be more a ſtranger to his Brethren, except he could make them like himſelf; or deſcend into their imperfection, and be like them:</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I am not juſtified, in rejecting or ſcorning infirmity: There is a time for all things, and a ſeaſon proper for weakneſs: A mixture of light and darkneſs, makes the morning pleaſant and growing: ſimplicity and miſtakes in children, is better then cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and politick exactneſs: Yea natural weakneſs is better then artificial ſtrength: <hi>Chriſt became weak for us,</hi> and what is any man, that he ſhould refuſe, what he choſe? or to be weak with the weak: much leſs to appear ſo, if he be ſo.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41851:22"/>
               <p>Exactneſs and compleatneſs is deſirable, and exceeding beautiful in its ſeaſon, when we grow up naturally to it: But we muſt come to it by degrees, and ariſe to it, out of weakneſs: In a child, perfect ſtrength or wiſdom, ſeems ſtrange and monſtrous; if it be feigned or affected in any, it is Serpentine, deceit and hypocrifie.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if we refuſe to do good, becauſe we would and may do better, or beſt of all, we reject the firſt degree of good, which is the root and foundation, both of better and beſt: And cruelly ſlay and deſtroy the firſt ſpring and buddings of life, which are the fountains, that only can nouriſh and feed unto perfect ſtrength, and Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there is in it, as diſtruſt of <hi>Truth, God</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſo of a mans ſelf, and his own life: If a man have any <hi>true life</hi> in him, it is ſufficient to carry him forth into the world, becauſe it is better and greater then the world: <hi>He that is in you, is greater then he that is in the world:</hi> By diſtruſt and diffidence of a mans own life, he weakens it: It is the deſign of the enemy, to keep us in fear and bondage of ſpirit: If that life that is in me, be true, it is beſt when it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: all art and contrivance do weaken and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41851:23"/>clog it: If it be not true, it is abominable hypocriſie, to perſonate an holy or heavenly thing: We ſee, all ſtudied and made things, come to baſe ends; they will wear out and leave a mans ſoul deſtitute: But true and genuine life, will ſtand and increaſe: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would be natural; as in all things, ſo eſpecially in Religion; which though it is ſupernatural, yet is never good, if it be not alſo natural: Yet I may not wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the exerciſe, either of fancy or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in compoſing and forming things; for that they alſo are natural faculties; and are excellent when the ſpiritual life doth purifie them, fill them, and rule over them.</p>
               <p>By this you ſee the firſt and great evil in this Book, and in my mind, in writing of it: delaying or dallying till another ſpirit had entred: and ſo long, till all parties were ſo engaged and diſturbed, that they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, nor clearneſs of mind to examine the reaſon of it: For which I was ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted, and threatned; not only to the rejecting of my preſent work and Miniſtry, but of my life alſo: Yet it was a ſin, not of wickedneſs, but weakneſs; and therefore I found mercy, and God accepted of a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from me; and not only permitted me
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41851:23"/>to proceed in my work, but continued and enlarged his aſſiſtance, and healed my foul alſo: Which gives me hope, that though the book, and my ſelf ſuffer awhile; yet I and others may at laſt reap fruit and comfort from it: It is for the preſent in the fire, and let it be tryed throughly, that all may ſee what is in it.</p>

               <p>YOu have ſeen the firſt and great evil of the book, its unſeaſonable birth, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by my delaying to write it, when the things contained in it, firſt offered themſelves to come forth: You have likewiſe ſeen the ſevere chaſtiſments ſuffered for it; and animadverſions upon both: If this evil be really removed and taken away; and what I have written, may a little calm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your minds, but into a willingneſs to read it, and ſeriouſly to ponder the things contained in it; other defects, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents and effects of the former, may be cured.</p>
               <p>There is a continual ſpring and growth of light in my mind, which makes me diſtaſte this day, what I wrote two or three dayes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41851:24"/>ſince: this made me ſuppreſs things; and not giving them vent in their ſeaſon, they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed ſo faſt upon me, that at laſt they crowded out, one over another, ſo thick and in a huddle, that people know not what to make of them; whereas had they marched out in their own order, although rude and natural, yet they would have been more perſpicuous and ſo more eaſily diſcerned and underſtood: There is, I am ſure, a ſtrange miſtake in men, even of the very drift and nature of the book; ſo much wide of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that I wonder at it: beſides other cauſes, this may be one; things preſſed out ſo faſt, when they found the door open, that they obſcured themſelves by multitude and force: Being born <hi>in turba,</hi> they are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſtrife from the womb; and then it is no wonder if they diſturb others.</p>
               <p>But this is a curable evil, if any will be at the pains to part the notions and conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, and take them aſunder, and ſet them at a greater diſtance one from another: I do think he may have another view of them: The matters contained in the book are very weighty, concerning the great change and turn in the Nation, by which the lives and liberties of thouſands are in danger: The things written, and manner of writing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41851:24"/>them are not vulgar, moſt people ſay they do not underſtand them: They that have read it often ſay, it hath in every new read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a new face: When I review it my ſelf, I find more in it, then I apprehended when I writ it: I profeſs when I conſider it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think of mens ſlighting of it, without an indignation: I muſt deal freely with you, when I hear of your unworthy and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſcorn of it, my ſoul doth upbraid, and wonder at that ſhallowneſs and froward headineſs that makes you ſo uncapable of the juſtice, reaſon, and mercy that is in it: I do know, and am able to write it, upon mature deliberation, and conſultation, That there is in it that love and righteouſneſs, that muſt and ſhall be conſidered and underſtood: And that very fury, that makes you impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the reaſon and rebuke of it, will run you upon a fooliſh and deſperate op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the preſent Providence and Power, and ſo bring you into miſery: And then you will repent of your too late conſidering, as I have of my too late writing. I could return ſcorn for ſcorn, and auger for anger; it is in me to do it; you know you are liable to it, and may know I am able to do it: But ſuch is my love to you, that I cannot but earneſtly deſire you to mind and ſtudy the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41851:25"/>things: I dare promiſe you, you ſhall not loſe your labour; if that which is there written do not anſwer your time and pains, do but complain of it to me, and you ſhall have ſatisfaction; It is but juſt you ſhould: and I have ſuch opinion of my honeſty, and ability, as to aſſure you, if it doth not perform to you, I will.</p>
               <p>Another fault is found in the Book, that it is too ſharp and cutting in the reproofs of it: It is a ſenſible complaint in ſome, I have the more reaſon to Animadvert upon it, becauſe it is ſo: If they be afflicted at it, there is great reaſon it ſhould afflict me alſo. Of all repentings, I find the eaſieſt and ſweeteſt, is to repent of anger: God hath made it eaſie and honourable, by his own example, who hath often repented of his juſt rebukes upon his people: It is eaſie in it ſelf: for anger is no pleaſant thing: If it were not neceſſary, no man could chuſe it: Indeed, it is ſo mean a thing, that few men enter into it in judgement: Moſt men are thruſt upon it, without underſtanding: I think I may ſay all; It is ſo unruly and troubleſom a gueſt, that none but fools will entertain it; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Anger reſts in the boſom of fools:</hi> If it be juſt and good, it is mean and poor; but if it be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41851:25"/>malicious, wicked, and falſe, then it is devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh: Be it what it will, I alwayes find it as yet, an offence to my weak nature; it alwayes wounds and ſtings me; therefore I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be jealous of it, and of my ſelf for it.</p>
               <p>If there be a ſowr and ſevere ſpirit in it, it may poſſibly ariſe from the firſt ill root, deferring or delaying to give it forth in its ſeaſon, when twas tender: the keeping it ſo long within, made it more fierce. But if the nails be too long, we may pare them, I will be better then ſcratching and clawing.</p>
               <p>Angry and vehement reproofs do abound in this Age: You reprove and condemn your adverſaries to utter deſtruction; and they condemn you: I have rebuked you, and you rebuke me, as a man irrecoverably loſt: The Nation is ſo full of judgement, that men can adminiſter little elſe: wrath is ſo ſtrong, that moſt men are quite drunk with it; love and peace is ſo weak, that they that incline to it, find great difficulty in exerciſing any of it: It may be for the good of all to underſtand the nature and kinds of rebuke.</p>
               <p>There are four ſorts of it ſubject to my obſervation: The firſt and worſt is deviliſh: A malicious ſearching into, and aggravating
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41851:26"/>the ſins of them we hate; and accuſing of them to make them odious, that we may appear juſt: or a finding but iniquity in them that are oppoſite to us, that we may deſtroy them: There is a great deal of this; it is meet you and I ſhould conſider how far we have been in this ſpirit: it is a very groſs and common evil; yet no diſcerned: becauſe them that we proſecute with ſuch enmity, we firſt paint them in our fancies, as devils &amp; enemies to God, and then think we do well, to deſtroy them, believing they are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it: But I hope this darkneſs will not laſt long: For no parties now ſtand in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition one to another, at ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as the children of God, and the children of the Devil: Becauſe if any were indeed the children of God, they would be like their Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44, 45. <hi>Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, pray for them that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitefully uſe you, and perſecute you: That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. How contrary is mens ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary practice to this! We ſay we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and therefore ought to deſtroy our and Gods enemies: to do good to ſinners, and to them that hate us is Divine: to hate, accuſe, and deſtroy, is certainly Diabolical.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:41851:26"/>
               <p>The ſecond kind of rebuke is Legal or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical: To reprove and puniſh men, as Gods children and creatures, in a holy zeal for God and righteouſneſs, with intention to humble, ſubject, and reform: and that from a holy and pure Law, and from a juſt and godly nature and life: This is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, or divine diſpenſation, but a legal one: yet who is there of you that can juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by this Law? Conſider it ſeriouſly: Do you reprove and puniſh men as men, as brethren, as Gods creatures and children, though enemies? Do you do it, with intent to humble and reform, or to ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy? Do you do it from a holy, pure Law, or from your own conceptions of the Law, which are broken, uncertain, and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Do you do it from a juſt and godly nature and life? or is there not alſo envy, covetouſneſs, ſelf-ſeeking, partiality, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs? you may ponder theſe things in your hearts, and meaſure your ſelves by this rule.</p>
               <p>The third kind of rebuke or reproof is Evangelical, that which was adminiſtred by Chriſt, when he was in the fleſh: he was <hi>a Miniſter of the circumciſion,</hi> and did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe in his Miniſtery; he Miniſterd ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cuttingly: but when he had done that,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41851:27"/>he was lead by his Father, to lay down his life for them that he had ſo reproved, and after he had diſcovered ſin, in a holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in obedience to his Father, and in all his work <hi>knew no ſin,</hi> yet he himſelf <hi>was made ſin.</hi> His Father by a ſuperiour Law, judged him as the ſinner, and acquitted, pardoned and juſtified them: This is Chriſts way, firſt reprove ſeverely as a legal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, purely and holily: and finding that ſhort or weak, he layes down his life for them he had condemned: And when he had adminiſtred the Law in its higheſt purity, he then nailed it to the Croſs, as a weak thing that could not ſave: and died under it, to bring in a better Law of peace and forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt is the beſt: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of the Spirit; which Chriſt prefers above his own, John 16.7, 8, &amp;c. <hi>It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you: And when he is come, he will reprove the world of ſin, and of righteouſneſs, and of judgement.</hi> Chriſt reproved of ſin from righteouſneſs: The ſpirit reproved of ſin, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Chriſt reproved of ſin, in the fleſh, in weakneſs, as under it and the Law, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41851:27"/>ſo grieved at it: The Spirit reproved of ſin, and of righteouſneſs, in glory and power, becauſe, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I go to my Father,</hi> where he was glorified; Being now exalted not only over their ſins, but by the worſt of their ſins, by their crucifying of him, <hi>The Son of man was lifted up:</hi> His love and life overcame both Law, Sin, Death, and the Devil: having taken away their ſins, his Spirit could now manifeſt to them, this one only ſin, unbelief: That there was in him, love, peace, pardon and ſalvation for them and their worſt ſins, hatred of him: that he had born them himſelf, and was acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them, and ſo they were all done away: and this ſin only remained, that they believed not this bleſſed and mighty grace, that could overcome all that evil and bring forth glory to himſelf, and good to them, out of their ſins, and his death: And this the Spirit did not only declare, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſo ſtrongly, that they could not reſiſt it. For his own deſcending upon them was an undeniable proof of it: He <hi>convinces of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> by ſhewing that they had a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as well as ſin: and that as their ſins were Chriſts, ſo his righteouſneſs was theirs: that their righteouſneſs was with the Father, in a heavenly inviſible ſtate,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41851:28"/>
                  <hi>becauſe I go to the Father:</hi> That this is true, his own coming, as Gods gift, is a ſufficient proof: And therefore it is conviction with judgement; or, of <hi>Sin, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Judgement.</hi> For except both the evil and the good be produced, both Sin and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the light and power of the Spirit, there may be wrath adminiſtred, but not Judgement: It is ſaid, of <hi>Judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prince of this world is Judged:</hi> And that is true Judgement, that convinces the creature of <hi>Sin,</hi> and of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and by the Spirit releaſes him, and judges the wicked one, the enemy, that is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, the author and worker of all this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
               <p>This Judgement doth right to man, to Chriſt and to God; to man, it humbles and abaſes him, and brings him to God, where his righteouſneſs is; It doth right to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the ſufficiency of his love, life, death, and reſurrection, to ſave the world: And it exalts <hi>God,</hi> his love, mercy, fulneſs, and juſtice: that he hath the righteouſneſs of the whole world with him; and that he hath accepted <hi>Chriſt</hi> to it, as Lord and Prince of the whole world, as head of man; and hath given him power and ſpirit to reveal and diſpence that righteouſneſs freely to whom he will.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41851:28"/>
               <p>Now it much concerns you, and me, and all men, that are buſie in reproving others, to examine our ſelves by theſe <hi>things,</hi> what kind of reproofs we do adminiſter: If you will admit your work to be tried, which you now cannot avoid: upon a little humble and ſober conſideration you will find, that in the adminiſtration of condemnation upon the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, of Church and Kingdom, perſons and things, officers and offices, you are very much ſhort of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of theſe, which I call a Legal or Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical reproof, and puniſhment for ſin: For true, legal, lawful, or angelical juſtice, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred; Firſt, upon men as Gods creatures, made in his image, and ſo his children, though drawn away by Satan into the worſt evils. It is ſecondly, not to ruine or deſtroy, but to reform. Thirdly, it is by a juſt, holy, ſtable Law, and not from mens uncertain and broken imaginations. Fourthly, it is from a juſt, holy and godly life and nature: If theſe things be true, as they are; then conſider, What ſpirit have you acted in? Is it not mercy and, juſtice to you, and all men, that this ſhould be known? That you dealt with them, not as men, but as brats of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: And ſought not to reform either perſons or things, but to deſtroy, root

And that by no ſteddy known Law, of God or man; ſuch you never could own or profeſs: but by uncertain opinions and imaginations; which you never were, nor could be true to, or agree in, either for Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: yea generally, ye acted beſides all rule, Law, and authority; only by that you call <hi>neceſſity, ſelf preſervation</hi> and <hi>intereſt:</hi> And this you did not from a pure nature, as is too groſly manifeſt, but from a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at leaſt, of pride, envy, malice, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and ſelf-ſeeking; ſeen now by your ſelves and all men.</p>
               <p>If you fall ſo ſhort of the ſecond, I know you will not preſume once to think of the third kind; which Chriſt our Lord admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the fleſh: firſt to diſcover ſin, and then to bear the curſe and puniſhment of it himſelf: This was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But plainly the queſtion now is, Have I ſo done?

               <p>That which makes you ſenſible of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of ſin only, in the book, and not of righteouſneſs, is this: It fell upon you in the very nick of time, when you were under judgement and condemnation from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: which is, I confeſs, a very bitter cup: for men to fall of a ſudden, from the higheſt of rule, and reigning, to ſhame and puniſhment; you were ſo drunk and drowned with this <hi>wine of wrath,</hi> and ſo full of anguiſh, that you had no ſenſe of any thing but wrath: Men drunk with paſſion, while the fit laſts, are not capable of the love or reaſon of friends, but thruſt them away as enemies: which renews my ſenſe of my firſt and gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <p>My buſineſs was to be <hi>dayes-man</hi> between adverſe parties: I know I did not intrude into the office, but refuſed and excuſed, as <hi>Moſes: Who am I? they will not believe, nor hearken to my voice.</hi> I am a man of no power or eſteem: and ſo put it off till I was compelled to appear: and now I find the common fate of them that interpoſe, to part the fray; both parties fall upon him.

               <p>But you do not only judge me to be an enemy, but worſe, an apoſtate brother; and more wicked then your open adverſaries, for they only afflict the outward man; I fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſpirits and principles; We ſhall have occaſion to diſcourſe of ſpirits and

               <p>Firſt, It is I confeſs a very difficult thing to judge of principles and ſpirits, becauſe they are inward: and therefore ſtrangers and enemies cannot judge of them: It muſt be ſome friend or brother, that hath converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them: They that are ſtill under them; are judged by them, and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge of them: It muſt be ſome that have travelled through them, and have had experience of them: ſpirits and principles are Gods: and who can judge the Gods? If any, they that have been amongſt them, and tryed them: you may from this find ſome reaſon, why I ſhould be choſen, to do this ſervice for you: you generally know me; my way and work hath been trying of ſpirits many years.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it is difficult to judge ſpirits and principles, ſo it is hard to bear the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them: Men can eaſier die and lay down their natural lives, then ſuffer their principles to be touched; Men of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon honeſty, do freely expoſe their fleſh to death, to ſave their Gods, although they be but Idols.</p>

Can all this ſmoke of confuſion darkneſs, and enmity be amongſt you, and no fire of falſe ſpirits? Can there be ſo much reeling and ſtaggering, giddineſs and inſtability, and no <hi>wine of fornication?</hi> no ſophiſticated or adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated wine?

Muſt man only bear the blame, and not the unclean ſpirits that are gone out? Or muſt God and his name only ſtand accuſed; that he, led his people by his Spirit into no better wayes? Is it not then both juſtice to his name, and mercy to man, that theſe evil ſpirits and

               <p>The plucking up theſe principles that lie deep and ſecret, is I know terrible; I have felt it ſo; It ſeems to threaten the rooting out of religion and godlineſs it ſelf; I have found the ſame thing in my tryals: God comes againſt them, and his people engaged with them, in great jealouſie, enraged as an enemy, in fiery indignation, and vengeance: becauſe nothing but his vengeance can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them: but I have found great love in theſe fires of jealouſie: yea love to our nature, and perſons, with <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> to our <hi>iniquities,</hi> even then when he <hi>takes vengeance of our inventions.</hi>

               <p>As ſin, ſo ſhame hath its own cure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its curſe, with it; He that obſcures himſelf for ſhame, or from it, and for fear of it is driven into a hole, muſt ſuffer double. And there is reaſon for it; becauſe firſt he is weak, and then a coward; and ſo deſerts himſelf, his name, his mind, his cauſe; and betrayes his life and, righteouſneſs, if he have any in him: If a man be upright, he need not go into a corner; if he do, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand upright in that hole and corner: holes are for Bats and Moles, for dark crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the light is for truth, and the open

               <p>As I ſee a neceſſity, and my duty, to caſt off all coverings; ſo I now experimentally find, how little you have of the Spirit of God, or of true reaſon: and that both theſe are exceeding low, in the minds of men at this time: If not quite ſlain, yet very feeble, weak, and ready to die; impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned alſo and ſhut up, under falſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fancies of things: And therefore if we think to inſtruct men, it muſt be; not only by truth; but with that evidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration that may heal and recover, mens ſpirits arid underſtandings.</p>
               <p>I profeſs this, that the ſame eternal Spirit that wrought thoſe things in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and writ them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> keeps that image in himſelf; and by it, contains and upholds the Scripture, the outward image of his eternal mind; and the ſame ſpirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to himſelf, produces the ſame works now, from the ſame foundation; and from the ſame light, gives forth a diſcovery of them: yet becauſe the works were wrought long ſince, and in a remote part of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41851:36"/>the earth from <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> in <hi>another world,</hi> and at <hi>Mount Ararat:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to us ſtrange and forraign things, or at beſt, but alluſions: Whereas to a ſpiritual man, all times and places are preſent, and all things in heaven, and earth, and under the earth, are gathered into <hi>one, even into Chriſt:</hi> In whoſe ſpiritual perſon we at once ſee and meaſure all things and ages: becauſe they are all in him, and made by him.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible that there is as much ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of reaſon in men, as want of the Spirit: For we are the natural children of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and do as truly derive our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from them, as we do from our Fathers or Grandfathers; yea we derive our ſelves more from them, becauſe they are heads, roots, and common or publick Fathers or Stocks of mankind: our immediate parents are but means, branches, or conveyances of life from thoſe roots to us: And we are more certainly and infallibly the children of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> then of our later Anceſtors: And do receive greater benefit from them; Moral, Natural, and Perſonal bleſſings from <hi>Adam:</hi> theſe renewed by <hi>Noah,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us by him, with the addition of civil and politick bleſſings: And theſe given by

That Power, that Army they raiſed againſt the King; turns to the King, and againſt them that raiſed it: It was long dying, and every Party watched to have had it themſelves, and were pulling and catching at it; ſome had it one while, and ſome another; whileſt quarreling amongſt your ſelves, it is faln into your Adverſaries hands; and that I ſuppoſe is the great trouble: You would be content it ſhould die, and you would <hi>execute</hi> it; but thought alſo, it belonged to the <hi>Executor,</hi> to have its riches, honours, power and ſucceſs: But it ſeems there was an elder Brother, an heir alive, that you did not dream of: Though this work of yours, with its power, fall very contrary to your hopes, deſigns, purchaſes, and carnal confidences; yet not contrary to many hints of propheſies, in their own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

               <p>To ſatisfie you, know this aſſuredly: 1. Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity &amp; unrighteouſneſs had got a Sanctuary in and amongſt you: and was lodged more ſecure in your profeſſions and gifts, then in any company or ſtate of men in the earth: and therefore 2.

Sin and ungodlineſs got ground of you, in your greatneſs and riches; you know it did: And while you thought to reform the world, you were deformed by it; and that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that engaged for righteouſneſs againſt the world, betrayed that cauſe; and fell into the unrighteouſneſs and filth that it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: The Lord rejects this pretender, in great jealouſie: know aſſuredly, God in this act is gone forth with vengeance againſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs, and will manifeſt himſelf in ſuch

Know, God hath ſet his holy Son upon his holy hill of <hi>Zion: The Lord reigns in righteouſneſs:</hi> and in righteouſneſs hath brought you down for your unholineſs: and if you have any true love to holineſs: but a ſpark of the truth, of what you profeſs, you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce more in theſe fires, while they conſume you, and your droſs, then ever you did in your ſucceſs and greatneſs: becauſe God is now avenging himſelf of his wicked enemies, that lurked in the prayers, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, gifts, prophecying of his kingdom; and for the world, trouble not your ſelf with that: he hath laid you aſide as unworthy of, and falſe to the work of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which you profeſſed; he that refuſes that ſpirit, becauſe it was unholy and baſe, hath a more excellent ſpirit, which he will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to the purging of all things and all men: I cannot without ſome indignation paſs this point: that men ſo palpably corrupt, and unclean, when under rebuke and judgement, and that for their impurity, yet ſhould think, that they are the only Champions of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: as if the cauſe of holineſs did die or fall with them! No, it is iniquity and hypocriſie that falls: There is an incorruptible holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41851:43"/>that is mighty, and will throughly purge away yours and others droſs, and cleanſe the whole earth.</p>
               <p>As to the things that I write in my Book concerning his Majeſtie, and thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> laid in <hi>Noah,</hi> and in that Covenant, which God made with him and his ſeed for <hi>perpetual generations;</hi> which I affirm to be the firm foundations of all the Kingdoms of the world: that <hi>tried ſtone,</hi> tried firſt in all Nations, and then laid in <hi>Zion,</hi> and is now the root of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties reſtoration, after his long ſufferings: I confeſs the things are deep, and remote from common underſtandings: What I feared and writ concerning theſe principles, I find true: that they are <hi>little underſtood, being yet low and under a vail, and therefore might appear remote and ſtrange, both to his Majeſtie and the Nation, which way prolong our trouble, &amp;c.</hi> They are ſo indeed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood neither by one ſide nor other; Let them lie and ſleep a while; foundations muſt do ſo: when ſhaking and troubles make us need them, they will be enquired after: if any do, there they are.</p>
               <p>But my friends, let us reaſon a little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and lay aſide all alluſions, and all paſſions, and ſoberly conſider what evil was

Suppoſing his Majeſty and the Law of the Nation, to be offended, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked againſt them that took away the life of the late King: what probable or rational way was left, to ſave the Priſoners; but by moving that they and their principles, and ſo the principles of the whole party, ſhould be tried in a higher and more ſpiritual Court: A trial muſt be; the common Law, and ordinary way certainly deſtroyes both life, liberty, and eſtate: To avoid that, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt be propoſed: What reſts to be tryed, but opinions and principles? And how can that be done humanely, but by ſuch a Court, and by ſuch a Law, as is there propounded? If thoſe principles are good, they may not only be juſtified, but prevail to rule: if they be not found ſo, then their deceit will be diſcovered, your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments delivered from them, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41851:44"/>and Party in a fair way to be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, and reconciled to the preſent power: Or elſe a third and middle ſtate would have appeared: A large, righteous, and merciful Law might have been produced, that might have united, comprehended, and ſaved both Parties: I confeſs freely, I do believe and know, it is to be had, and will come forth, whenever the righteous and good Law of God, may obtain among men, and right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be heard.</p>
               <p>I confeſs to obtain this, I did declare to his Majeſtie, my ſenſe and judgement of your principles; which I have long had, and do ſtill retain, upon a judgement made by many and great trials in my ſpirit; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by conſtant experience, much exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and deliberation: And being many years fully convinced of, humbled, and ſore afflicted for that prophane, carnal, cruel, and ſelfiſh ſpirit, in which this work was begun and carried on, I did and do ſtill offer them up to trial; and was and am ſtill willing, that his Majeſtie and the Nation might ſee, that they need not ſeek the lives of men, ſeeing they might have the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which is the beſt ſatisfaction can be given.</p>
               <p>It is that which I have long deſired, even
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41851:44"/>of this Party, when they were up, That we might have a Bar of Religion, and Reaſon, where the right of all parties in the Nation may be fairly argued and heard; but could never obtain it: I do judge it the true and only Chriſtian, and humane way, to come to Peace; and therfore I ſhall and do earneſtly deſire it: <hi>There is nothing in the earth that I do ſeek more then this, That my mind and judgement may be tried by the Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Nation; or the Reaſon and Religion of the Nation, tryed by my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had it been a known enemy, that had propounded ſuch a thing to you, why ſhould you be angry at it? or why not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and ſeek it? For a people that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves Spiritual and Saints, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a war, to the expence of ſo much blood for their Religion, and at laſt wave an argument for it; it is ſtrange: you will ſure in time examine the reaſon, why it ſhould be ſo; And conſider whether that cauſe be truly Chriſtian, that avoids a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian trial; that ſhrinks from reaſon, and will not appear againſt its enemy, but in arms, with a rude and tumultuous rable: Truth and integrity, cannot but rejoyce in a combate of Reaſon: and it is groſs guilt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41851:45"/>and carnality, either in the cauſe or perſons, that declines argument, and flyes to brutiſh force.</p>
               <p>If you fear treachery, that your principles might have been drawn out, and ſo your perſons expoſed to danger: That wiſdom that makes you ſuſpect, would enable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch danger: freedom of diſcourſe, is commonly granted in time of arbitration; with ſecurity againſt taking advantage by ſuch diſcourſes: But alas, neither you, nor any other, no not your enemies, can poſſibly bring forth your principles ſo ill-favoured, as they have appeared in action: I dare ſay, there is no man in this Nation, but his Reaſon or Religion will teach him a better ſtate of things, then hath been acted in the Nation, ſince theſe wars begun; that no mans mind or reaſon is ſo crooked and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as the ſeries of actions have been: It will be found that poor men, have been hurried and thruſt into many things, either by company, incogitancy, the influences of the ſtars, or rather the predominancie of evil ſpirits, by the irreſiſtible fate of times, or ſome ſuperiour over-ruling determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Providence: Few men have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed judgement in theſe wars; either hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or Chriſtian, but have been toſſed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41851:45"/>about, by the earth-quakes, and violent commotions of greater powers: And if we could come but to look into mens minds, when paſſions and furies are over, we ſhall ſee that men are better things, then they have appeared in this Scene of War: And that at bottom there is but one man, one nature, one religion, and that a good one: Therefore I know I am a friend to you and to mankind, in ſeeking to draw forth the reaſon of men, to ſift and trie principles and opinions. But there is ſo much jealouſie and accuſation in the world, that men are not only jealous of all others, but of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo. If men misjudge mankind, they muſt needs misjudge themſelves: the firſt they do, it is too manifeſt: and therefore cannot be wholly free from the ſecond: It is ſure your too hard thoughts of your ſelves, and ſuſpition of your principles, that makes you afraid to appear in them: I know there is a ſtrong paſſion of fear upon you; a great dread of ſufferings in your minds: And all your thoughts are, how to bear the evil of this day; ſo drowned in a ſenſe of it, that you can hardly think a thought of any thing elſe, nor admit of a propoſition of peace and ſafety to your ſelves.</p>
               <p>It is true and evident, that the way and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41851:46"/>courſe of your actions, have been directly againſt the antient power, authority, and Law of the Nation: And you are unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſet in an oppoſite and contrary ſpirit to them: and have done as much againſt them, as you could: You thought you had laid them all low enough, and had buried them ſo deep, that they could never riſe again: And that you had gotten into a <hi>heaven,</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt, or ſo near it, that all danger of ſuffering had been quite paſt:</p>
               <p>But now you ſee, that all the weight and ſtrength of your Prayers, Gifts and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, together with your Armies, cannot keep down the things that you oppoſed, nor uphold you againſt them: But contrary to all your thoughts, when you were ſtrongeſt they roſe up againſt you. A ſtate, law, and power of a Nation, is a mighty thing; and to riſe up from death and the curſe, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you had ſent it) provoked againſt you by ſo many and great injuries, muſt needs be very terrible to you: It would ſcare a man to ſee his enemy alive, that he thought he had ſlain, were it but a ſingle perſon: But to find the whole Magiſtracie and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Nation, the King, Nobility, and Gentrie, with many thouſands of oppreſſed people, riſe up againſt you, in all the power
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41851:46"/>and ſtrength of the Nation, Civil and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary (all which have ſuffered from you) I know it muſt needs aſtoniſh and amaze you; coming upon you ſo much contrary to the aſſurance you had (as you thought from God) of a better ſtate: I do not wonder when I conſider it, that you are overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fears, and deſpair of receiving any good from them, that riſe from that pit of deſtruction, into which you had doomed them for ever: looking upon them as you do, as Antichriſtian, enemies to God, and for in rejected, you cannot expect good from them.</p>
               <p>You are ſo oppreſſed with the evil that is upon you, that you ſink into reſolutions of ſuffering, and judge your ſelves loſt for the preſent; and your thoughts are only to bear the indignation that is upon you: You could not forgive your ſelves, nor your enemies; neither could your enemies forgive you: I do forgive them, and you; and ſo ſhall, do the worſt you can: For my love is abſolute, without condition, and therefore without repentance: In love to you, I propoſed a ſacrifice, and an atonement: Which is not your honeſty or godlineſs: but theſe things which we call principles, (I care not to call them ſo any longer) I mean opinions or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41851:47"/>which I ſay, are deluſions, deceits, or at beſt broken, imperfect, and ſhort apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or miſ-apprehenſions of things, that have miſled you in all your buſineſs, into ſuch crooked pathes; that perverted your Counſels, corrupted your ſpirits, and made you a vexation to your ſelves and friends, a burden and ſcourge to the Nation: Theſe would I have found out, and ſacrificed, that not only your honeſty and uprightneſs may be diſcovered, which is certainly another thing from them, but that your lives and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties may be preſerved alſo.</p>
               <p>But neither ſide, would regard what was offered: You would not part with your opinions, called principles, no nor offer them to tryal Neither would the Law, and authority of the Nation accept of any ſuch ſacrifice: but being of a more outward and earthly nature, hath required outward and bodily ſatisfaction: What could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, we muſt be content patiently to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>

               <p>WE may now hope, that this ſcene of blood is over, and that the Law and Authority of the Nation is ſatisfied, if it be not again provoked by new attempts upon the peace: My ſoul is a friend to peace, and an enemy to deſtruction: And therefore I ſhall, I hope, perpetually ſeek Peace, and endeavour to prevent miſchief: May I now obtain ſo much favour of you, in your low and afflicted ſtate, as calmly and rationally to conſider, what I have and do propoſe; weigh it well.</p>
               <p>I do affirm, that there is that good in the office and inſtitution of a King; and that good in the nature and perſon or his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,</hi> as a man and a Prince, if we conſider no more, that you may live under him, with more Peace, ſpiritual comfort, more holineſs, and godlineſs, and with leſs ſin and evil, then you have done all theſe wars, or ſince: This I affirm upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a ſure root and foundation laid by God and Jeſus Chriſt, in the beginning of the world (now manifeſted and revealed) ſo firmly and ſtrongly, that no humors, paſſions, or luſts of men, nor any ſpirits and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41851:48"/>powers of darkneſs can overthrow: ſo that what ever men ſay or do, the foundation is ſure; they may prejudice themſelves, and deprive themſelves of the comfort and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it, but the foundation remains firm: for it is that <hi>tried ſtone,</hi> that hath born all Nations, in all ages.</p>
               <p>I have likewiſe affirmed to his Majeſtie concerning you, and your way and work: that the ſpirit of that Miniſtrie, in which you acted againſt him, is dead: that your power both Civil and Military hath reſigned to him; and that the principles, or opinions being proper only for that work of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of their own nature weak and ſhort, are reducible: And then, that there are in you, thoſe gifts and abilities, that may be of ſingular uſe to him, and the Kingdom: So that upon a good underſtanding between you, the King may be happy in you, and you in him.</p>
               <p>As the thing propounded is not only juſt and <hi>honeſt in the ſight of all men:</hi> but alſo good and profitable for all Parties: <hi>To you,</hi> no leſs then ſaving of life, liberty and eſtate: <hi>To his Majeſtie,</hi> ſecurity, honour, and the great advantage of the hearts, affections and judgements of a great and conſiderable people: And to all the Nation, that rich
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41851:48"/>bleſſing of Peace: in knowledge and right underſtanding: So the means propounded to this end, is as innocent and ſafe: That wiſe, ſober, and ſpiritual men, of large hearts, and indifferent in their judgements, ſhould have the hearing and trying of mens principles and opinions.</p>
               <p>The end being unqueſtionably good, peace and love: and the means to that end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, a trial of mens opinions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wiſeſt and beſt in the Church: We cannot reaſonably doubt of a good effect: except we conclude one of theſe two things: that there is not with men, or in the Church, that Grace and Spirit of Chriſt, which is able to judge and lead into a way of Peace: or elſe that men are not willing to receive that bleſſing of Peace, though it ſhould be manifeſted: No man can conclude the firſt, without the guilt of unbelief: and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of the Promiſe of God, that his <hi>ſpirit ſhall abide</hi> with his people <hi>for ever:</hi> nor the ſecond without great injury and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs to mankind: But if his word and Spirit be with us; and that Word and Spirit be ſufficient for that end, whereunto it is given, which is to purifie, enlighten, heal and unite the body of Chriſt; (to deny it is blaſphemy againſt that Spirit) then
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41851:49"/>walking according to the rule of that Word and Spirit, we need not doubt of obtaining that end, which is ſo much according to his own nature; which is love, peace and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Why you ſhould think that ſuch a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſhould come from an enemy, I can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to nothing but this, the extremity of your anguiſh, under your fore and grievous loſs and diſappointment; which makes all things ſeem harſh, while the mind is drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that ſenſe: It is true, you meet with ſharp reproof there; but you muſt come to find true love in the ſevereſt reproof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can be ſoundly healed. Propoſals of a Treatie and Peace, for the preventing of preſent and imminent danger, uſe not to be the way of enemies: If ſuch things ſhould come from a profeſſed enemy, I think the nature of the things deſerves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and not ſcorn or reviling: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I think you have wronged me, and the Book, and I therefore might require repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of you; I know in time you will give it: There is that right and reaſon in you, which will give me ſatisfaction, when it ſhall recover it ſelf, from the paſſions of fear, grief and anger; which now darken and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:41851:49"/>
               <p>In the mean time let us conſider, whether there be not ſomething in the Book, that is yet improveable for the good of the whole Party that ſtand in oppoſition to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, and ſo are in danger to be deſtroyed by it.</p>
               <p>We hope his <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> and in him, the Law is ſatisfied, and by that ſacrifice of blood that hath been ſhed, is attoned, as to paſt things: yet the breath is not healed, but your ſpirits are ſtill ſet in oppoſition to the power of the Nation; and the Law and Power of the Nation, looks upon you with jealouſie and an evil eye, thinking that yet you may attempt againſt the Peace of the Kingdom: Great diſcontent appears in you; it cannot be hid; all endeavours are uſed to uphold, and revive the cauſe; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that enmity and war that hath formerly been acted againſt his Majeſtie and Party.</p>
               <p>This is ſeen, known and felt; and doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly provoke the Power of the Nation, to endeavour the ſuppreſſing the Party, for preventing future inconvenience: It cannot be otherwiſe, all men do it: When you had the Power, you did as they now do: you interrupted their meetings, and required Oathes of them: This now fills the priſons,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41851:50"/>ruines many Families, exaſperates mens Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into bitterneſs and wrath, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the ſweetneſs and comfort of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wounds the life and power of godlineſs, and grieves the good ſpirit of love and peace in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>What ever you think of it now, I know it is in it ſelf a good and mercifull work, and will be ſo acknowledged by you in time; to reconcile a poor broken people, (guilty by Law, and their own conſciences,) to the authority and power of the Nation, in which they live. For a naked people, to be in their judgements and affections zealouſly ſet againſt the Law and Government of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is provoked, and enraged; newly recovered and reſtored; experienced, fore-warned, and fore-armed againſt them; what ever may be expected hereafter, there is in it, apparent ruine for the preſent: Alas, a Law and Power, is an Iron Scepter; and in the hand of a ſelf preſerving ſpirit (ſuch as was in you, and is in all men yet) muſt needs be hard to them that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemies to it.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of it wounds my ſoul, and affects my bowels of compaſſion to you; which urges me to do what I can, to prevent miſery to your perſons and families:</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:41851:50"/>
               <p>And therefore I do earneſtly entreat you to conſider ſeriouſly, whether your botom upon which you ſtand, in this divided and oppoſite ſtate, to the preſent power and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Church and Kingdom, be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bear you up, againſt what you are likely to ſuffer if you perſiſt.</p>
               <p>The foundation upon which you ſtand, is this; You preſume and conclude, Firſt, That you are the ſelect and only <hi>people of God;</hi> his <hi>Zion,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the true and only <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Saints:</hi> And thoſe that you oppoſe are <hi>Aegypt, Babylon,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> Secondly, that your <hi>way</hi> in which you have and do walk, and the works that you have done, and would do again, are according to the pure <hi>word</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of God; and that which you oppoſe, is all <hi>Wickedneſs, Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry:</hi> Thirdly, That the <hi>war</hi> in which you have been engaged, and upon which you ſtand, is the <hi>way</hi> of God according to his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>word,</hi> and therefore hath been and will be owned and juſtified by him.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing all this, that you are the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God,</hi> and <hi>Zion, in Gods way</hi> and <hi>word,</hi> engaged <hi>in his cauſe,</hi> againſt <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> there is then an unqueſtionable ground and aſſurance of a bleſſed ſucceſs,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41851:51"/>from the manifold promiſes of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>But if this be not true; and that you in this ſtate, and in this oppoſition, are not <hi>that body</hi> that ſhall attain thoſe <hi>promiſes:</hi> And <hi>this</hi> be not <hi>the only way of God,</hi> in which you walk, and this <hi>war</hi> and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be not the means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, to attain that glory you expect; then be your intentions never ſo good and zealous, your prayers never ſo fervent, your gifts never ſo many, your conſtancy never ſo great, yet you will fail; and the further you proceed in it, the greater your loſs will be.</p>
               <p>If all this ſhould be true; that you ſhould be <hi>the people,</hi> yours <hi>the way, war the means:</hi> yet if you fail but in the circumſtance of time: if this be not the time determined for the fulfilling of what you expect; there is righteous and mercifull reaſon, for your retreating, from ſuch an oppoſition and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
               <p>To have faith exerciſed, about the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, to be fulfilled in theſe latter dayes to his people, is an excellent thing; whereby God will have glory, his people deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and the whole earth peace; But you may have a ſight of this at a diſtance, and know aſſuredly, you ſhall have your ſhare
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41851:51"/>of it; and be entertained with great joy concerning it, have ſtrong perſwaſions about it: and yet may not attain it, in that ſtate of enmity, and oppoſition in which you ſtand; but in another more large, holy and ſpiritual way; Or the whole Church may enjoy it here, and your ſouls for ever: and yet your bodies may fall as <hi>carkaſſes in the wilderneſs,</hi> for the impurity, carnality, uncharitableneſs, frowardneſs, and enmity of your way, and ſpirits in your preſent ſtate: And therefore it is love and mercy to you, to put you upon a thorough tryal and examination of your bottom, ſpirit, and way.</p>
               <p>I conſider not now your particular forms of Worſhip, which are various, and oppoſite one to another; Nor your private and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal holineſs, fear of God, conſcience of his commands, obedience to his word, ſo far as you know; which are not only to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but approved and encouraged in a right way, and in a right ſpirit: but I would conſider, the way, actions, and work of the whole body, in this publick engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, againſt the Government of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and your private forms, gifts and godlineſs as they have acted, and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the ſame oppoſition: in order to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41851:52"/>turn your minds towards that, which elſe is like to ruine your ſelves and families.</p>
               <p>If this great affair and cauſe, in which you have acted, and do conſtantly perſiſt in, be the right, and that you are <hi>the people,</hi> yours <hi>the way,</hi> this <hi>the means</hi> and <hi>time</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the glorious things expreſſed in the Scripture; then you muſt have theſe two things for your foundation, ſtrength and rule; the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God: If you are led by them, and ſtand in them, you will certainly prevail: if not, you will fall, and muſt repent.</p>
               <p>We may conſider them either joyntly or ſeverally; for though they are two, yet they are one alſo, and never ſeparated.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider the word of God, the Scriptures: There are three great works of God, declared in it: The deliverance of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Aeypt,</hi> The redeeming of them out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> And the grace and ſalvation revealed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: We have built our work upon all theſe, and do think that our cauſe is the ſame with them all: and therefore we have been fed continually with ſtrength which we got, as we could, from them all: But whether our work do juſtly &amp; evenly ſquare to any of them is the queſtion: I am fully
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41851:52"/>ſatisfied in my ſelf, that it doth not: And that you, if you will be ingenuous, and in any meaſure of uprightneſs, examine what you have done, you will quickly find; that you have not in your whole buſineſs come near your foundation, and pattern: I ſhall only hint ſome few things to you, as they do occurr, and leave you to conſider the reſt.</p>
               <p>Only by the way, be perſwaded to think and feel, that you are but men, and may err: many may err: many good men may err: actually you have erred: though you be much better then others, yet you may err, and err greatly; ſometimes the beſt people err moſt; <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſinned beyond all the Heathen: God will ſhame and humble all; and make <hi>firſt laſt,</hi> and the <hi>laſt firſt:</hi> the beſt worſt, and worſt beſt: <hi>The Jews that ſeek,</hi> ſhall not attain: <hi>the Gentiles that ſought not,</hi> ſhall attain. You differ one from another, and ſo muſt err one againſt another: you have <hi>all ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore you may have erred, as to this buſineſs, fundamentally, and either not know your bottom, or be upon a falſe bottom And ſo through loſs and miſſing, come to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a true &amp; right bottom. If once you be but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41851:53"/>willing to be tried, you will quickly ſee much.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Iſratl</hi> had a King and High-Prieſt given of God, to be their Leader and Guide: he was alſo himſelf their Leader; he went before them in the wilderneſs, in a <hi>pillar of cloud by day, and of fire by night,</hi> and never left them: We had neither King nor Prieſt, no Guide nor Leader, but left to ſhift for our ſelves, and wander from one thing to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41851:53"/>another, as our own crooked and blind rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon led us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They had Officers ſent by God, which did call them forth, and then continue to judge them, and God maintained his own, and their authority over them: We were called out at firſt, not by Officers from God, but by part of that we call <hi>Egypt,</hi> or the world; by the Parliament, which we uſed as <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or worſe; we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw them and their authority.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a <hi>Law</hi> given them from <hi>heaven,</hi> and <hi>one Tabernacle</hi> built for all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>pattern,</hi> in the Mount of God: We never had a <hi>Law</hi> from <hi>heaven</hi> to govern us, but were left to the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of the world: No <hi>pattern</hi> for a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> but every one built ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own mind; which muſt needs make diviſion, and ſo bring confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God deſtroyed Egypt with his Plagues, and armies of <hi>Frogs, Lice, Flies</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts;</hi> but we our ſelves were theſe Armies, that eat up this <hi>Egypt:</hi> we were the <hi>Frogs, Lice</hi> and <hi>Locuſts,</hi> that vexed the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Iſrael</hi> were led out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> into a Land that <hi>the Lord their God gave them:</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:41851:54"/>We could never get out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor had we any Land to go to: They were <hi>driven</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> we drove <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and kept <hi>Egypt</hi> for our ſelves: the goodly buildings, the riches, honours, preferments, and all the Laws, Ordinances, and Cuſtoms of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and could do no other wayes: for we had no Land of our own to go to.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> firſt tasked and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, then perſued <hi>Iſrael:</hi> We had got the way, of tasking and oppreſſing <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then perſued <hi>Pharaoh</hi> into the Sea, and beyond the Sea. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Charets</hi> and <hi>Horſe-men</hi> were drowned in the <hi>red Sea,</hi> for his purſuing <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And now our Charets and Horſe-men, are drowned in a kind of a Sea of confuſion; and it was for perſuing with endleſs and implacable enmity.</p>
               <p>Here is a wide difference betwixt us and our foundation; and as wide an end: There, <hi>Iſrael</hi> overcame, here, <hi>Egypt</hi> overcomes: And if that be our bottom, and we build ſo very far from it, we cannot expect a better end.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider the ſecond ground, the redeeming of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> whether we have been truer to that Copy: we have
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41851:54"/>made great uſe of thoſe Scriptures, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Promiſes; how juſtly, muſt be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not deſtroy their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <hi>Babylon</hi> and the <hi>King of Babylon</hi> was deſtroyed by the hands of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> under the command of <hi>Cyrus</hi> a heathen Prince, but anointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: But we have deſtroyed <hi>Babylon</hi> our ſelves; and therefore have hitherto acted but the part of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> the part of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is yet to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> God viſited them by a <hi>King</hi> of their own, <hi>Moſes, Who was King in Jeſurun:</hi> In this deliverance, God viſited them in the <hi>Emperour Cyrus,</hi> and charged him to build his houſe: And the <hi>Jews</hi> moved not but by Proclamation, Command, and Commiſſion from the Prince. When a ſucceeding <hi>King Artaxerxes,</hi> forbade them to build the City, they ceaſed; until <hi>Darius</hi> made a new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, enlarged their Commiſſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the work: Afterwards another <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was ſtirred up, to give command for the carrying on the ſame work, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of all the wants of the builders: We had no ſuch authority for our work: but on the contrary, we went forth upon our own
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41851:55"/>heads, at our own pleaſure, according to our own minds: without any authority; and overthrew the Authority of the Nation, becauſe they would not joyn with us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Iſrael</hi> were the known <hi>people of God,</hi> viſibly diſtinct from the world; owned to be ſo: Even by thoſe Princes in whoſe Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they were: God gave them <hi>honour in the ſight of the heathen, where they were carried captive:</hi> We have no ſuch viſible character, no ſuch juſtification; but aſſume it to our ſelves, and deſtroy others, becauſe they would not ſo <hi>honour</hi> us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as they were outwardly and viſibly <hi>the people of God,</hi> ſo they were the known heirs of that Countrey, to which they went; they had an unqueſtioned Civil right to it; although they had been for a time, ſequeſtred from it for their ſins: And when they returned home, they recovered but what they loſt, enjoyed their own Temple, Prieſts, Tithes, Offerings: But we, not content with our own inheritance, uſurp other mens rights: Indeed the parallel fits the other ſide much better: who have been for their ſins driven out, and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their inheritance; to their <hi>Law, Church, Temple</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> from which they were ſequeſtred and driven away</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:41851:55"/>5. When God brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> he inſtituted the ſame Officers, <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Prieſt,</hi> that he did, when he brought them out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> For <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> then, there was <hi>Zerubabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> now: and to thoſe was given a <hi>ſpirit</hi> that would <hi>ſcatter confuſion; a line and plumet, the ſeven eyes,</hi> the fulneſs of the Spirit, to furniſh them for the repairing the Temple and City of God: <hi>The two anointed ones, that ſtand before the Lord of the whole earth: which through the golden pipes, empty the golden oyl out of themſelves.</hi> And therefore it was then, <hi>not by might nor by armies, but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord:</hi> But alas, we have no <hi>King,</hi> nor <hi>Prieſt,</hi> no <hi>anointing to ſcatter confuſion,</hi> but confuſion ſcattered us: Our Motto may be contrary to theirs: <hi>Not by Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but by might and by Armies:</hi> For we were ſucceſsful in nothing elſe, but in force and arms: Therefore if the Scripture be a rule to meaſure your actions, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs you have groſly erred, and walked not only in crooked, but in contrary pathes to it.</p>
               <p>Conſider fairly the third diſpenſation of God to his people, the grace and ſalvation revealed by Chriſt and the Spirit in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: <hi>Goſpel-Ordinances, Goſpel-Saints,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41851:56"/>Goſpel Order,</hi> and a <hi>Goſpel-Spirit,</hi> have been much ſpoke of: I am grieved at my heart for you, to think that any men ſhould be ſo groſly deceived, or deceive themſelves, as to perſwade themſelves, that ſuch works as you have done, and ſuch a way as you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, ſhould have any countenance or authority from the holy and pure Goſpel of of the <hi>Lamb of God:</hi> For though you have endeavoured to frame your outward forms of Worſhip, according to the outward letter of the Goſpel: yet you have denyed and oppoſed both the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lamb</hi> and <hi>his Apoſtles:</hi> and that not only in thoſe things which you call miſcarriages, but in the main of your work and buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt Chriſt begins his Miniſtrie with bleſſing; he bleſſed <hi>the poor in Spirit, them that mourn, the meek, the merciful, the peace-makers, the perſecuted:</hi> ſo he taught, ſo he practiſed: he was himſelf a <hi>Lamb;</hi> he ſent his Diſciples out <hi>as Sheep among Wolves;</hi> and commanded, <hi>reſiſt not evil, love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, pray for them which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you, that you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. This was the Law of his whole Life and Death; <hi>He that will be my
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41851:56"/>Diſciple, muſt deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me.</hi> Alas, alas, how can you look into this glaſs, and not bluſh to ſee the deformities of your whole work, how directly contrary yours is to this: Inſtead of <hi>bleſſing,</hi> you have <hi>curſed;</hi> What he <hi>bleſſed,</hi> you reject; the meek, the mourners, the merciful, the peace-makers, the perſecuted; you begun this war, becauſe you would not endure perſecution: Inſtead of <hi>not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting evil,</hi> you have inflicted evil, and would not be reſiſted in it: Inſtead of <hi>loving enemies,</hi> you have hated and deſtroyed them: Inſtead of <hi>bleſſing them,</hi> you curſe as bitterly as you can: Inſtead of bearing <hi>perſecution,</hi> you perſecute: Inſtead of <hi>denying ſelf,</hi> you ſight for ſelf: Inſtead of <hi>taking up the Croſs,</hi> you flie to force to avoid it, and load others with it, make others bear it. So hath the bleſſed God ſet things, that they that are <hi>not with him, are againſt him:</hi> And they who refuſe to bear the Croſs, muſt become Crucifiers of others: All men that will not endure perſecution, they will perſecute; they that cannot or will not be killed, will kill. So have you done, and therefore been <hi>enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt;</hi> and ſo ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſt himſelf; for he is crucified in all crucifying: And they that <hi>hate the fleſh
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41851:57"/>of the whore, and burn her with fire, they make war with the Lamb alſo,</hi> Rev. 16.14. So have you made war with the Lamb, with his doctrine, nature, life and death</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt our Lord, <hi>humbled himſelf,</hi> and became <hi>a ſervant</hi> to others; you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted your ſelves, as far as you could, into all kinds of places of honour: <hi>He became poor, that he might make others rich:</hi> you have made others poor, that you may be rich: He ſuffered the errors and <hi>contradictions of ſinners;</hi> but ſinners (thoſe that you have judged ſinners) have ſuffered your contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, in your ſeveral Oathes and Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: He <hi>bore</hi> the <hi>infirmities and diſeaſes</hi> of the whole Nation; the whole Nation have born your infirmities and diſeaſes, your blindneſs, haltings and ſtaggerings: He bore the <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>curſe</hi> of the <hi>people;</hi> The poor people have born yours, both ſin and curſe: He <hi>died,</hi> that others might <hi>live;</hi> You <hi>kill</hi> others, that you may live your ſelves: He <hi>ſuffered, the juſt for the unjuſt;</hi> but others have ſuffered from you, becauſe they reſiſted your unjuſt power and will: I believe you have been miſled by an evil ſpirit; and therefore I pitty you: Alas, you have <hi>walked in darkneſs, and not known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have gone.</hi> You did not think your
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41851:57"/>way and work had been ſo contrary to the way of Chriſt: you found it weak and ſhort; but now you will ſee, that it is in the whole, from the riſe of it, to the end of it, contrary to the nature and ſpirit of the Lamb, and to his Law and Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> brought forth <hi>a new Creation, a new and Spiritual Kingdom, a new Law, new Ordinances, new Miniſters, new Worſhip:</hi> And this, not in oppoſition to, nor to the deſtruction or diſturbance of, any authority, either of the Jews or Gentiles; but he taught and practiſed obedience to both: But you have only diſturbed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, what you could, of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nation; but have brought forth no better, no <hi>new Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>new Law</hi> for the people: and what forms of worſhip you have made for your ſelves, and ſeveral Parties, are but ſome broken pieces of the letter, of the old Apoſtolical frame, ſet up in another ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Let us compare your work and way with the Spirit, and his holy and pure Miniſtrie: He came <hi>from Heaven, himſelf,</hi> cloathed with an outward and viſible appearance, in great Majeſtie and Power, openly manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to all Nations, in mighty ſigns and wonders, that were his own and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41851:58"/>He did truly glorifie Chriſt, and ſet him up above his enemies, making them know that Jeſus was the Son of God, and that the <hi>Kingdom of God was with men:</hi> And this to the face and in the conſciences of all the powers of the earth: He formed and built a <hi>Church upon the rock,</hi> from the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly pattern:</hi> He came from heaven, and carried the Saints into heaven, and made them <hi>ſit down together with Chriſt, in the heavenly:</hi> He led them <hi>into</hi> the holieſt, and brought them to <hi>Mount Zion</hi> indeed, <hi>the City of the living God, the heavenly</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>and to an innumerable company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to the general Aſſembly,</hi> &amp;c. Have you had the ſubſtance and truth of any of theſe things with you? You have been able to talk of them to notion, fancy, or propheſie ſomething of them, which others could not: But had you had <hi>this heavenly glory,</hi> you needed not your earthly Armies, nor worldly Polities, nor the help of profane and looſe people and practices to ſave you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spirit</hi> had <hi>his</hi> own <hi>manifeſtation, his union, his</hi> own <hi>tongues, interpretation of tongues, his</hi> own <hi>ſigns and miracles, his</hi> own <hi>power and glory,</hi> pure, holy and clear; <hi>his</hi> own <hi>anointing</hi> was ſufficient <hi>to lead into all truth:</hi> But inſtead of manifeſting, you have
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41851:58"/>by your wayes extreamly darkened others, your ſelves, and the name of Chriſt, and Religion which you profeſſed: Inſtead of tongues, and interpretation to others, you were in ſuch confuſion, that you could not your ſelves underſtand one another: you pretended to ſignal mercies and ſucceſſes; but they are not ſpiritual, but ſuch as are common to others: ſo is victory in battle: Inſtead of being led into all truth, alas you were led into all kinds of contradictions, and into many erroneous wayes, which proved to be lyes and deluſions to you.</p>
               <p>And therefore you muſt not any longer boaſt of the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> You cannot ſhew that he is deſcended upon you, or that he hath led you, as he did the Apoſtles, into a heavenly ſtate: You are ſtill in the world, in the groſs uncleanneſs of the world, in the wrath, malice, deſtruction, pride, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, deceit of the world.</p>
               <p>You are, and have been, under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie or Judgement of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> In his giving you up to corruption, that you may be manifeſt to be but men, and not born from on high: In blowing upon and infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating your Counſels; In ſcattering and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding your ſpirits: In rejecting your work and way, as not his own, as abominable to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41851:59"/>his purity, goodneſs, truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: In judging of you in the ſight of all the world, for abuſing his name: and in kindling a ſire upon all your riches, honours, and works; a fire of jealouſie <hi>that burns like an Oven;</hi> which will purifie you: And therefore you are in this day, nearer to the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> then you were from the firſt day you engaged.</p>
               <p>Conſider now what ground you ſtand upon, in your preſent oppoſition to this Power and Providence: You cannot ſtand up with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> in their Office: for you have not led us out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan;</hi> but have been intangled and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in <hi>Egyptian darkneſs:</hi> Nor can you ſtand up with <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel;</hi> they <hi>ſcattered confuſion,</hi> and brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Babel:</hi> you have led us and your ſelves into a <hi>Babel</hi> of <hi>confuſion:</hi> Nor can you <hi>ſtand before the ſon of man</hi> and his Spirit; alas, you are faln before him, judged and rejected by him for ever; never to he reſtored in that vile and abominable way, in which you ſtood and ſtill are.</p>
               <p>I deſire you to remember what is my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in this preſent diſcourſe; it is to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, and to bring you off from thoſe unſound principles, in which you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41851:59"/>and in which you will ruine, if you be not delivered out of them: And to ſhew you good reaſon for inviting you, as I did in my Book, to offer up your Principles to a fair tryal, in order to ſatisfie his Majeſtie, and reconcile you to his Government: And if you conſider what I have ſaid here, it will be found no wicked deſign, but righteous and merciful Counſel, both to your ſelves and to the Nation.</p>

               <p>And therefore thoſe revelations rightly opened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will extricate the Church, from her Babyloniſh enemy confuſion, and enable her to build up her ſelf again in glory, peace, light, and love: That line will alſo meaſure the late revolutions in this Nation. For I am fully ſatisfied that ſo conſiderable a work as this hath been, in and about both Church and Kingdom, was certainly in the Council of God, and alſo expreſſed in his word.</p>
               <p>But this much I know, that you have been as ignorant of that book, as you have been of your own work; and that you have not had, nor yet have <hi>a reed to meaſure,</hi> either the one or the other by: neither can you rationally ſix your work upon any one part of that book: Nor have you had light to make that, or any part of it, or of any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, a Law to you in your work: but have been driven on by ſnatches, without any

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41851:61"/>Prophetical Scriptures, to be fulfilled ſince Chriſt and the Apoſtles: and do find that neither of all theſe are your foundation; becauſe you have not kept to them, nor made them your rule: Before we give a final judgement, I ſhall ſhew you the thing it ſelf, that you have profeſſed and pretended to; that <hi>Zion,</hi> and that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which hath been ſo much talked of: I will a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail her to you, as ſhe is with me, and ſtands before me, and at this time going out of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. She is an holy Nation, City or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Holy and righteous, not by gifts, notion, purpoſe and prophecying; but by nature, and in the matter and ſubſtance of her being: being one with the Lamb, and ſo in her nature patient, innocent, meek: She is from heaven; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is from above; comes from God out of heaven, and is of the ſame nature with him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath his <hi>name written upon her;</hi> which ſhe could not juſtly wear, if ſhe have not his nature likewiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. She is an holy City or Nation, built and formed according to the eternal Law or mind of God, in moſt excellent union, beauty and order: and not a confuſed heap of prophane and filthy matter: She hath
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41851:62"/>both Magiſtracy and Miniſtry in equal and proportionable parts, all in order: She is built both according to the Law and Goſpel, and hath the beauty of both, and <hi>ſings the ſong of</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Lamb,</hi> in excellent harmony.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this ſtate, ſhe is joyned to the Lord, her <hi>head,</hi> in immediate conjunction and union: And the <hi>Lamb</hi> is with her, dwells in her: ſhe is the <hi>Mountain of God,</hi> or <hi>the City of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. She is waſhed, cleanſed, enlightened, and filled with the Spirit of the Lord, whereby ſhe is eſtabliſhed, ſtrengthened, guided and kept, in even and ſtraight pathes; ſhe is adorned and beautified with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, wiſdom, peace, honour and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore when ſhe appears, ſhe will be <hi>a praiſe in the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. She is in all things ordered and ruled, by the pure and perfect Law and Word of God, whereby ſhe walks ſteadily, ſurely, juſtly, to God, to men, and to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Theſe things, in word and notion, are not ſtrange to you! that <hi>Zion</hi> is a Body, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a holy People, united and compact according to the heavenly pattern, joyned unto God, ſanctified, eſtabliſhed and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41851:62"/>by the Spirit, ruled by the eternal Word.</p>
               <p>Then conſider and compare your ſtate with this <hi>Zion:</hi> where is this body, this holy matter? or when was this body form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? was it in the Parliament? at what time? though you ſifted and purged it, yet it was mixed, unclean and corrupt; and afterward rejected as chaff. Or was the Army this holy body, with all that vile and filthy rabble? If this was the body, how came it to be ſuch an offence to you? why did it at laſt caſt you off, and betray you and your cauſe? Or is it all the godly people? why then are you not drawn out, united, built in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a holy Nation, or City by your ſelves? <hi>Zion</hi> and no Union, Conſiſtencie or Order? No Magiſtrates nor publick Miniſters? Can you ſay when, in which of the <hi>ten powers,</hi> that you ſet up in twelve years, you were formed by the Spirit, or Word of God? which ſtate, Oath, Proteſtation, Covenant or Engagement was made by the Word of God? If all, then you were led into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, if any one, why did not that one judge and condemn all the reſt? and why doth it not ſtill ſtand and defend it ſelf and you? It grieves my ſoul to think, that you ſhould be ſo drunk with the wine of your own gifts and ſucceſs, as to need ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41851:63"/>demonſtrations, to convince you, of the evil of your ſtate.</p>
               <p>We have briefly ſhewed you the beauty of <hi>Zion:</hi> I can give you a view of your own ſtate, poſſibly you have not obſerved it, as I have done: now you have time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to think ſeriouſly of it: It is this.</p>
               <p>You are a confuſed heap, raiſed from the earth, by the tumults and commotions of the people, being impatient of ſuffering, and full of conſultations for ſelf-eaſe, ſelf-ſafety and advantage; actuated and ſtirred by the Providence of God, who can make uſe of all creatures, natures, and diſpoſitions: And ſanctified by, and furniſhed with a ſpirit and gifts, fit to execute his diſpleaſure upon the Nation for their ſins: Finding ſucceſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your expectations, you grew into high opinions and conceits of your ſelves; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Government of the Nation; break all Oathes and Bonds; prey upon the wealth of the Nation; enrich and exalt your ſelves, under a name and profeſſion of Godlineſs; for which you are rejected into miſery and ſhame.</p>
               <p>I do feel what effect this may have upon your minds; ſome will think it very hard and ſevere; ſo think all children when they

I would avoid it, if it were poſſible: but it cannot be otherwiſe: how can one write to a people, but all may read that will? But alas, I ſee it is moſt righteous and juſt, that you ſhould bear ſhame; for you have put the <hi>Lord to open ſhame;</hi> and your iniquities and abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are diſcovered, in the ſight of all the Nations: they cannot be hid; and publick ſins muſt have publick ſhame, publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and repentance, <hi>Eze.</hi> 16.52. <hi>Thou that haſt judged thy ſiſters,</hi> Samaria <hi>and</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>bear thy own ſhame for thy ſins, that thou haſt committed, more abominable then they: they are more righteous then thou; yea be thou confounded alſo, and bear thy ſhame, in that thou haſt juſtified thy ſiſters:</hi> And know for certain, that till you are aſhamed and confounded for your abominations, you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can, never ſhall, know a better ſtate: But when you ſee <hi>God pacified towards you,</hi> it will make you <hi>to remember, to be confounded,</hi> and <hi>never more to open thy mouth;</hi> And then will he lead you into a better ſtate.</p>
               <p>Therefore know this, I do not charge all this upon ſome eminent perſons of the Party,

               <p>The judgement I paſs, is upon <hi>the ſtate</hi> in which you ſtand, and <hi>the ſpirit</hi> by which you are acted: <hi>This ſtate</hi> which I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed to you, it is not <hi>Zion,</hi> but <hi>Babylon:</hi> Her filthineſs is diſcovered, in the ſight of all the world, and can no longer be hid: <hi>In one hour is her judgement come: Great is the Lord that judgeth her: Righteous and true are his Judgements, and they are made manifeſt:</hi> God hath openly ſhewed, what was in you; it is ſeen, known, and felt, that it is <hi>Babel,</hi> confuſion; <hi>Therefore is the name of it called</hi> Babel, <hi>becauſe the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord ſcatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth, Gen.</hi> 11.9.

               <p>As to your perſons, gifts and graces, I do admit them to be the Lords, and to belong to <hi>Zion:</hi> But it is Zion <hi>that dwells with the daughter of</hi> Babylon: Therefore I do write this, to call you forth of <hi>Babylon: Come out of her my people, and be not partakers of her ſins, that ye receive not of her plagues:</hi> Sword, war, blood, killing, perſecuting, wrath, curſing and deſtroying are her ſins, and muſt be her plagues: Neither you, not any men, can <hi>live</hi> in them; but they will <hi>periſh,</hi> by them: No man, or men, can <hi>act</hi> in them, but they muſt <hi>ſuffer</hi> them: It is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous jugdement of God againſt the <hi>beaſt,</hi> and for the <hi>Lamb: he that takes the ſword, ſhall periſh by the ſword;</hi> and the meek ſuffering <hi>Lamb</hi> only ſhall reign: If you had again, or could recover, all the power and force you had, and an hundred times more, you could hold it but <hi>one hour with the beaſt:</hi> And <hi>in one hour</hi> would you be <hi>made as deſolate</hi> as you have been: You neither could, nor can reſiſt it: For <hi>ſtrong is the Lord that judgeth:</hi> For he that hath ſworn, he will bring down them that exalt themſelves, be they never ſo

               <p>If you could not reſiſt this Judgement, when you were great and ſtrong, why ſhould you not be wiſe now, and ceaſe from that ſtate, and thoſe wayes, which lead you upon ſenſible ruine? For what more certain deſtruction can there be, then for a naked people to daſh themſelves againſt a rock of power and authority, that is rooted and grounded in the Laws and minds of the Nation, and now after proof and trial, riſes up ſtrongly againſt all its enemies?</p>
               <p>You are as to your perſons, part of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of God, I do moſt freely grant it to you: But as yet, but <hi>Iſrael after the fleſh,</hi> and no more: And God hath uſed you, and <hi>the fire</hi> of your fleſhly Zeal, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16, 17.) <hi>to hate the whore, make her deſolate, and naked, and to eat her fleſh;</hi> The war hath been of fleſhly knowledge, fleſhly forms, and fleſhly wiſdom, by fleſhly power, policy and arms, againſt outward and fleſhly corruptions: which God hath <hi>put into your hearts, until the words of God ſhould be fulfilled:</hi> And du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Miniſtry, you pleaded the cauſe of <hi>Zion,</hi> and had the name, title, and ſucceſs for that work: But thoſe <hi>words are fulfilled:</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:41851:65"/>And then there appeared in this <hi>fleſhly Iſrael</hi> and fleſhly work, a <hi>ſpiritual Antichriſt,</hi> which your own mouthes have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: and a <hi>ſpiritual Sodom, Egypt and Babylon;</hi> which your works have manifeſted. <hi>Sodoms</hi> pride, idleneſs, and fulneſs of bread: <hi>Egypts</hi> falſhood, cunning and cruelty: <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons</hi> loftineſs, glorying, and ſelf-exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Where our Lord alſo was crucified:</hi> As well as the <hi>fleſh of the whore deſolated.</hi>

               <p>Friends, I do earneſtly deſire you ſeriouſly to conſider, if you can, or if your high conceits of your ſelves, your principles and cauſe, will admit of reaſon and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41851:66"/>Then conſider, what is there in your preſent ſtate, which now lies under ſo great conviction in your conſciences, and ſo great condemnation from men: that ſhould make you diſdain, either a reproof, or a propoſal, of trying your principles at a bar of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Reaſon, before the wiſeſt, juſteſt, largeſt, and ſobereſt men, in the Church and Nation: For that was the intent of that Book, that you ſo fiercely and bitterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn: It was humbly deſired, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be tried, together with their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, might not be judged, at leaſt not final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the Common Law, but might have a Chancery: And why ſhould you not now be reconciled to it, and ſeek it? what ſhould hinder you from petitioning it, as a ſingular mercy? To the utmoſt of my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it might be, not only a means of ſaving your ſelves, but, a bleſſing to the Nation: I am very confident that you, and all men, after you have wearied and ſpent your ſelves, your peace and comfort, in theſe unnatural and brutiſh violences, will be glad to hearken to a brotherly and friendly debate of things: When that pride, that makes men ſcorn all mens Reaſon and Religion, but their own, is brought down: For he that knows any thing of the general and large love of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41851:66"/>God, and of Jeſus to all men, muſt conclude; that that pride, will as certainly be ruined and ruine it ſelf, as he knows God is juſt or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull.</p>

               <p>I Intended not to proſecute this point of accommodating the preſent diſtance and oppoſition that is betwixt you, and this Government of the Church and Nation: But being unexpectedly faln upon it, and engaged in it; and it being the end of my firſt Book, and the conſtant frame of my mind, to ſeek peace by a right underſtanding: And there being ſtill great need of it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the great numbers that do ſuffer; and poſſibly a better opportunity for it, ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being taken, to the Law of the Land, &amp; juſtice of the Nation, upon them that have ſuffered: The ſame love to you, that led me at firſt to propound it, continues ſtill in me, and leads me now to proſecute it.</p>
               <p>The enmity is ſtrong and great, confirmed by a long and cruel war; heightened and inflamed by many wrongs and injuries: It is a fire that hath and doth burn fiercely in the minds of men: It is now upon you, if it be

For none but a friend, will purſue enmity it ſelf, and my war is with enmity it ſelf, and my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is to deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore conſider, what it is that engages your minds ſo ſtiffly, in an oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to, and hatred of the preſent authority of the Nation.

Indeed I do not blame you for being angry at me; I rather blame you, that you do like women, fret and ſcold, but do not bring forth your reaſon againſt me: If there be any courage or ſtrength in you, I ſhall do what I can to engage it: It may be a mercy to you, to draw you off from a fleſhly and worldly conteſt with the Nation, which will ruine you: to a ſpiritual and friendly ſtrife about Gods, Principles, and Religions: In which war, we ſhall draw no blood, waſt no treaſure; deſtroy no families; nothing will be hurt, that is right and good; nothing be loſt, but the chaff and duſt: With <hi>this fire and ſword</hi> of Spirit and Word, will God <hi>plead with all fleſh:</hi> This is truly and only the <hi>war of God,</hi> for the <hi>cauſe of God:</hi> And <hi>the weapons of this warfare are not carnal but ſpiritual; mighty, to pull down the ſtrongeſt holds</hi> of the enemy: With this <hi>fire and ſword</hi> of the Word and Spirit, God <hi>pleads with all fleſh,</hi> with all Parties, with all opinions: Epiſcopal, Prosbyterian, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants, Anabaptiſts: A fleſhly war, by fleſhly means, in a fleſhly ſpirit of pride, envy, impatience, ſelf-ſeeking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy men, but encreaſes diviſion, multiplies
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41851:69"/>corruption, provokes ſin in the ſubdued, ſwells it in the conqueror, fills all with miſery. But this war is, of <hi>one God, one life, one peace, one ſalvation:</hi> againſt <hi>all men</hi> in their fleſhly oppoſing one another, and proud exalting themſelves one over another, and deſtroys no men nor ſort of men, but the evil and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all, it <hi>deſtroyes only him, that deſtroyes the earth:</hi> The ſtandard that I do advance in this war is love, the royal Law of love: love to man, to mankind, to all men, to humane nature: love to ſinners, to enemies, to the worſt of ſinners.</p>
               <p>You are religiouſly and conſcientiouſly engaged to oppoſe, pray againſt, curſe and deſtroy the preſent Magiſtracy and Miniſtry of the Nation, becauſe it is corrupt and ſinfull, both perſons and things: This was your cauſe and ſpirit; and ſtill is, except you repent and deſert the principles in which you have been acted. Againſt this ſpirit and religion do I advance this ſtandard: it was aſſerted in my former Book, but not raiſed high enough to be publikely obſerved or dealt with: It is more fully this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since God hath revealed his good will to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and his large mercy, to all men, to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and enemies, not only to the godly, but to the ungodly and unrighteous, and made his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41851:69"/>own example, a Law and Rule, in his houſe, to all his children: He that hateth his brother, is in darkneſs: knows not, lives not in the true light of Chriſt; is not of Gods mind: If he ſaith, he is in the light, and pretends to religion, and the way of God, he is a liar, and is in darkneſs until now, and knoweth not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goeth:</hi> 1 John 2.9, 11. I know this is exceeding ſtrange, and contrary to the whole frame of religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have been exerciſed theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years: For of late, all religion and light hath only ſerved to hate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy: and in this kind of religion the further and higher men go, the more they hate, and with more cruel hatred: firſt hate the evil Council, then the King, then the Lords, then the Commons: Firſt hate the Biſhops, then the Miniſters, then the Presbyterian equal to the Epiſcopal, then the Independant and Anabaptiſt Churches: then all Religion: and ſo one generation of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, ha h begot another, worſe and worſe; but no ſalvation, no healing, no pardoning any: Sure this is very different from that large and univerſal good will, that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by Chriſt. This hatred is condemned here to <hi>darkneſs,</hi> to the Prince of darkneſs, who is the enemy, the wicked or malignant
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41851:70"/>one: For if <hi>we walk in the light, as God is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from us all ſin: He is in the light, and in him is no darkneſs at all:</hi> the darkneſs is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, he doth not ſtumble, is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at it: he is pure and holy, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can pollute and defile him: <hi>he ſhines in darkneſs, and the darkneſs comprehends him not:</hi> thanks him not, loves him not; yet he ſhines ſtill. And they that have fellowſhip with him, may be, and are, where he is, and ſee as he ſees, do as he doth, and not be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted or offended: he that is taught of God, <hi>as God is, ſo is he in this world:</hi> he ſhines in darkneſs, and is not comprehended by it, nor ſubjected to it, nor offended at it: and therefore quarrels not with them that are in it: but pitties, pardons, and relieves them: yea though they are not only dark and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, but malitious and ſpitefull againſt him, and would deſtroy him, yet he ſets not himſelf againſt them: but on the contrary feeds, clothes, ſuſtains their outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, their bodies and ſouls; And this he doth as an example, and pattern to his children; If you ſee God going before you, in reſtoring, delivering, forgiving; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of following his example, you be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41851:70"/>at it, fret and curſe: and think that your wrath ſhould lead him, and your prayer call forth his vengeance: This is not like the Goſpel, nor like his Sons.</p>
               <p>There is another principle, which I will ſet at the foot of this ſtandard: <hi>Whoſoever hateth his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life in him,</hi> John 3.15. He that hateth his brother is a murderer: then he that murdereth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hates him: why elſe doth he murder him? He then that hates, and out of hatred endeavours the deſtroying or removing by death, them that he hates, is a <hi>hatefull mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer:</hi> And then to prepare war is hatred and murder, by the Law of love: It is not juſt or good, becauſe it is commonly done: It is not good, becauſe it is done by many, but worſe: If it be murder for one man to kill another, it is more murder for one party to kill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party: If it be done by a more religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous party, upon a more prophane party, it is ſtill worſe: Wars for Religion are worſe then for Civil rights: becauſe by ſuch wars, not only men ſuffer death, but the peace, purity, and love of Religion, which is the Law of Chriſt, is violated: Wars raiſed by a better people, upon a worſe (if we be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) is ſtill worſe, then for a worſe to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41851:71"/>raiſe war upon the better. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law and example of Chriſt, <hi>The ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the Weak, and not to pleaſe themſelves,</hi> Rom. 15.1. <hi>and the juſt to ſuffer for the unjuſt. It follows, no murderer hath eternal life in him:</hi> For if any man have eternal life in him, he need not, he cannot, out of fear, that another will take away his life deſtroy him: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he prey upon anothers life, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own: Nor can he take away the ſinfull life of another, to ſecure his eternal life; it is contrary to divine reaſon and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But he that hath eternal life will be enabled to lay down his life for others; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows his life is eternal, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be loſt: This is according to our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, ver. 16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> By this we perceive that his love was the love of God, that he could lay down his life for us; and that his life was the life of God, that it could lay down it ſelf for us: And <hi>we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren:</hi> If this be truly and only, the nature of the love and life of God, and a rule to us: Then that only is true godlineſs that anſwers to this pattern:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41851:71"/>And what is contrary to it, is of <hi>the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You cannot, you muſt not think to ſlight and ſcorn the authority and Majeſty of this ſtandard: if ever you be ſaved, you muſt come to it; if you be ſaved by it, you muſt alſo be judged and ruled by it: I am able to ſay it doth ſave, and ſhall judge and rule you and all men: and therefore by this, I muſt and will try and meaſure your preſent ſtate and cauſe.</p>
               <p>You profeſs, in this ſtate of oppoſition and enmity wherein you have been and are ſtill engaged, the <hi>cauſe of God and godlineſs.</hi> Is there <hi>a cauſe of God,</hi> that differs from himſelf, from his life and love? or another <hi>godlineſs,</hi> then that which is born of him, and conformed to him? Doth he lay down his life for us that are ſinners, and enemies; and give the ſame life to us, which he laid down for us, that we might be like him? and ſhall we, becauſe we are his children, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy others that are not ſo?</p>
               <p>If this be light, and a rule, then your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in which you ſtand, is darkneſs, and you are lead into it by a falſe God, by an evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by a crooked rule.</p>

               <p>ALL enmity is betwixt two parties; this enmity being in darkneſs, there is a falſe judgement of both: He that hates is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of himſelf, and of him or them that he hates; in both reſpects the darkneſs of malice <hi>blinds his eyes, and he knows not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goes:</hi> In your preſent enmity, you are guilty of both: miſtaken and deceived, 1. In your ſelves: And 2. In your enemies; If there be theſe two errors, there muſt be a third alſo, ignorance of the way that you are in, in proſecuting theſe enemies: You think you are engaged in the cauſe of God, and that you move in the way of God, againſt the enemies of God. But you will find that you are blinded by the enemies in all three; and that you are not what you think you are: nor are your enemies, that which your hatred ſuggeſts they are; nor is the way of oppoſing and deſtroying, what your enmity imagines it is: In all, <hi>your eyes are blinded, and you know not whither you go:</hi> It will be a mercy to you, if God pleaſe, to open your eyes, and to turn you from this way of wrath, into <hi>the Way of peace,</hi> we ſhall endeavour it.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:41851:72"/>
               <p>Firſt, for your ſelves, you take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1. That the cauſe in which you ſtand is the cauſe of God: 2. You conclude that that religion and holineſs in which you live, is the only godlineſs and Chriſtianity: I doubt you are deceived in both.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, the cauſe, it is cryed up among you, as the Jews cried up, <hi>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord:</hi> I fear your cry hath leſs ground then theirs: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever while the ſound of it lives in your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it is no wonder if it over-powers you: For there is certainly nothing more high and honourable, then to be engaged in <hi>the cauſe of God;</hi> to be his friends, and champions, and to be imployed in recovering of a Kingdom for Chriſt, and ſetting him upon the throne: All that are called to this work may well be zealous in it, and freely adventure their lives for it; knowing they ſhall have a great reward for it: and whatever their lives or ſins are, they ſhall at leaſt go to heaven, if they dye in the quarrel; the ſervice is enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for all.</p>
               <p>Beſides what we have ſaid in the ſeventh and eighth Section: That this cauſe, as you have managed it, agrees to no rule or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Scripture: Not to the way or work of God, in delivering <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:41851:73"/>nor to that of bringing them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> much leſs to the way of the Goſpel in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> nor to the prophetical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: nor to the thing it ſelf which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, as we have I think convincingly ſhewed: And beſides that ſtandard of <hi>the love and life of God,</hi> ſet up in the laſt Section: all which you muſt either overthrow, or ſubject to: I ſhall now deſire you more particularly, and cloſely to conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether this cry of <hi>the cauſe,</hi> be not only a great ſound, or more ſound then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Empty veſſels give the greateſt ſound: Moſt noiſe, leaſt truth and ſubſtance, is very common: Or things when they go off, make the greateſt report: This I have obſerved of this cauſe: it floats like Wine in mens heads, fills mens Prayers and Sermons, flies about in Books and Diſcourſes, and ſo raiſes a ſmoak of talk, zeal, and affection. But in all this time: Firſt, It never attained, or gathered a body, into any conſiſtency, but mens minds are ſtill blown about like duſt: one people talk this, and another that; but there never was any conſent or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about it: 2. As it never could gain a body, ſo it never had any form, it was never yet ſtated by any man, or by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men: only confuſed thoughts and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41851:73"/>talks there are about it. Thirdly, it never yet attained any power in the Nation: it never was owned as the cauſe of God by either Parliament or Army: Men in their private prayers and Sermons, talk of the Kingdom of God, of the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and building <hi>Zion;</hi> but thoſe powers owned nothing but neceſſity, ſafety, intereſt of the people, and ſuch like things: And therefore you may well think what a bottom it is, that you adventure your ſelves in; or rather, how bottomleſs it is: Many words, many affections, many duties, multitudes of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, many Scriptures quoted, preached on: But what power and ſubſtance is there in theſe? What heavenly glory is there in them or among you, that is able to convince your enemies? Or what earthly ſtrength is there in them, that can defend and ſupport a poor naked people, againſt a ſtrong and mighty Prince, againſt a ſtanding Law and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? My reaſon, experience, and knowledge tells me, that as you are, ſo you will be left in confuſion, in any engagement, for ſuch a cauſe, that hath no more ſolid body, ſtate or power in it.</p>
               <p>And therefore be perſwaded to retire, from the noiſe that you make in each others ears and affections; and enquire within in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41851:74"/>your own reaſons and memories: And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member if you can, where had you this Cauſe? from whence came it? where and when was it born? in what year of theſe late changes? in which of them was it brought forth? Or from what <hi>Scripture</hi> do you derive it? is there ſuch a thing ſpoken or named there, as <hi>the Cauſe of God?</hi> God pleads the <hi>Cauſe of his people,</hi> by outward Judgements; and by his Spirit <hi>the Advocate;</hi> and by Chriſt their <hi>Counſellor:</hi> But <hi>his Cauſe</hi> is not now at the Bar; no, he hath ſet Chriſt upon the throne, and he is exalted <hi>far above all principalities and powers:</hi> He is now actually judging and ruling the world: <hi>he pulleth down and ſetteth up</hi> whom he will: You may feel his power and authority, he judges you, for your unrighteouſneſs, and ſets up your enemies above you: What is it that thus blinds your eyes, that you ſhould contend, or that which is already done, for Chriſts Kingdom? doth not the enemy abuſe your underſtandings? and perſwade you, it is the Cauſe of God, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when indeed it is your own honour, dominion and greatneſs?</p>
               <p>But hath there not been a cauſe of God in this Nation? Yes there hath been that which we may call ſo: and it was this, The
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41851:74"/>Church and Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> ſtood in a very dark, fleſhly and corrupt ſtate; and the Governors of it were alſo corrupt, and had ſinned againſt God: For which God had <hi>a Controverſie,</hi> both with their perſons and ſtanding: And therefore <hi>ſanctified</hi> you, with a <hi>fleſhly holineſs,</hi> againſt their <hi>fleſhly corruption,</hi> and called you forth for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of his judgement upon them: And therein you were juſtified, being engaged (to ſpeak in your language) in the cauſe of God; or being employed to adminiſter that judgement which he had given in <hi>the cauſe:</hi> Thus much I can grant to you, and it will be found the right of the caſe.</p>
               <p>But if the Judgement decreed be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and the meaſure of outward puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be fulfilled, then your <hi>cauſe</hi> ceaſes: If this kind of wrath, by war, blood, and ſpoil be finiſhed; why ſhould not you be content to be diſcharged from this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is a mean ſervice to be the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of an outward deſtruction: It is, <hi>O Aſſyrian, the rod of my anger, and the ſtaff in their hand is my indignation: I will ſend him againſt an hypocritical Nation, and againſt the people of my wrath will I give him change, to take the ſpoil, and to take the prey, and to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41851:75"/>tread down like the mire of the streets,</hi> Iſa. 10.5, 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it is a vile ſervice, ſo it hath been vilely polluted: It is a filthy thing to deſtroy, and the filthineſs of it is manifeſted: It is <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and the <hi>confuſion</hi> is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcovered: The brightneſs and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, and all the honour, and glory of it was, the wrath and juſtice of God: when that was finiſhed, then it preſently ſhewed its vile nature: covetouſneſs, ſelf-ſeeking, pride and cruelty: Nothing but ignorance, or a love of the prey and ſpoil, can make men to doat upon it, and deſire to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, being it ſelf unclean, it cannot purifie nor reform the Nation: It reaches but to the out-ſide, to the outward life, honour and greatneſs: It never touches the ſpirit, and therefore may waſte and ſpoil, and ſo reſtrain, for a time, the fleſhly part; but the nature and ſpirit of the thing ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, yea confirmed and ſtrengthened: It may tread down in the mire, but its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean feet of wrath and paſtion, pollute more then purge, and ſo make worſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to purifie, is left to the fire of of his own Spirit; which will thorowly purge, with the ſpirit of judgement and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41851:75"/>burning: You adminiſtred 1. without judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you could not diſcern between the gold and the droſs. And 2. without burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for if the droſs be not ſeparated from the gold, it cannot be conſumed: as yet we have had neither ſeparation nor burning: for want of both theſe, their droſs ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, after all the wrath adminiſtred: But doubt not, the holy <hi>purpoſe</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of God: He will certainly purge both you and them: by <hi>the breath of his mouth, and the brightneſs of his appearing:</hi> This pure <hi>heavenly fire,</hi> is deſcended, is kindled, is <hi>ſet as a refiners fire;</hi> and no iniquity ſhall eſcape the flame of it: For it is holy, mighty, effectual and eternal; it doth, and will burn for ever: You have heard the ſound of it in your ſpirits; ye are in the ſmoak of it, and ſo is the whole Nation, which is the reaſon of the preſent blackneſs, darkneſs and confuſion: But when the evil is brought forth and diſcovered, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deſtroy it: yea it is actually deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in deſtruction; in being brought forth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That outward wrath which you adminiſtred, you could nor but execute it: you could not ceaſe from it, till it was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; but you have ſince turned from that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41851:76"/>cauſe, and made another: which is planting your ſelves, in the place of them that you thruſt out; exalting your ſelves and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry upon their ruines. Pray obſerve, Firſt, That the great things now boaſted, of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and reign of the Saints: which are indeed eternal truths and ſure things, but the application of them to your perſons, gifts and Miniſtry; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending of them to your ſelves in your lace work; are things that are ſprung up ſince the beginning of the wars; and are the children or idols of the ſucceſs you have had in the wars; theſe notions were not known at firſt: the war was betwixt King and Parliament: opportunity, advantage, and ſucceſs, made you bold to aſſume theſe titles. Secondly, you could not claim this title to the Kingdom of Saints, till <hi>Babylon</hi> was deſtroyed: In aſſuming of it, your own works declare that miniſtry of wrath, to be finiſhed, you did believe, profeſs, praiſe and practice accordingly: And therefore you cannot return to it again, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting your own judgements and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea thoſe very judgements and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in which your ſtrength lies. Obſerve it well, The preſent Governors and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Church and Kingdom, are ſay you
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41851:76"/>
                  <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the enemies of God and his people: You therefore did execute the wrath of God upon them to deſtroy them: Was that juſtice or wrath perfect, full and compleat or no? If it was, it finiſhed, and you have no more to do of that kind: you certainly thought it ſo, perfect, and ſufficient, and ſo believed, praiſed, and lived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Babylon</hi> being deſtroyed, <hi>Zion</hi> comes forth: you own your ſelves to be <hi>Iſrael, Gods people;</hi> and that <hi>the Kingdom is the Saints:</hi> which you could not do, till <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was deſtroyed: for <hi>Iſrael</hi> cannot come forth, nor have her liberty till then: This ground you now ſtand upon; not upon the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as at firſt, but as <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Gods people:</hi> and this title ſtands only upon the ruines of <hi>Babylon:</hi> Therefore either you muſt hold to this, that you are <hi>Zion,</hi> and then <hi>Babylon</hi> is deſtroyed; and then you are not to engage again in a war againſt her: Or elſe if you think <hi>Babylon</hi> yet ſtands and is not deſtroyed, you muſt relinquiſh your confidence and title of the Kingdom of Saints, and go back again, to begin a new heatheniſh work and war: But you have been the <hi>ax wherewith Chriſt hath hewed, and the ſaw that he hath ſhaken,</hi> and as fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh proud man uſes to do, you have <hi>boaſted</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:41851:77"/>and <hi>magnified</hi> your ſelves and miniſtry (into the place of Chriſt, and ſo) <hi>againſt him</hi> that heweth therewith: and for that you ſuffer ſo great ſhame and rebuke.</p>
               <p>I have endeavoured to let you ſee, that, that which is the moſt of the cauſe of God, that ever you had, which is the execution of his juſtice, is now finiſhed and ceaſed: And that in love both to your ſouls, lives, liberties and families; that I might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw you from this way of enmity and oppoſition in which you ſtand, and in which you will ſuffer, if you do not retreat.</p>
               <p>The true ground of our war ceaſing, which is the adminiſtration of, an outward puniſhment; the <hi>cauſe of God,</hi> as to that point ceaſeth: And therefore you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in your cauſe, paſſion having blinded your eyes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that ſtrengthens you in your enmity, is your holineſs, religion and godlineſs: This muſt be tryed, whether you be not deceived in it alſo.</p>
               <p>It conſiſts much in Religious duties, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by gifts, as praying, ſpeaking, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying, and an outward conformity to the Goſpel: For the power and Spirit of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, is not manifeſted in you, by any ſigns or fruits; or not more in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41851:77"/>you, then in others: There is nothing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular produced, but what is common to others, only your manner of ſpeaking, praying, worſhipping: which is affirmed to be, 1. nearer to the rule, and 2. of more power then others: And that the worſhip of your enemies, is ſuperſtition and humane invention, and hath no life in it.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certain, that this kind of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Holineſs, is not with God what you eſteem it: You do highly, yea too high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly value it: But it doth not, it cannot ſtand in the preſence of God; not in his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preſence: but is of a worldly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſtands only in the world: It is not the worſhip, that is in the Temple of God, before the throne of God, and of the Lamb; I hope you will confeſs it: For you know there is no ſuch contention, war, blood, curſing, nor ſuch mixtures of uncleanneſs, can or dares come before him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though it ſtood awhile as a Miniſtry, yet it is faln, and that before him: For what cannot ſtand before him, falls before him: The reaſon of his diſlike of it is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is not of a right kind: It is not a new nature; not a nature, but a gift; not a divine nature, but a humane thing; not from heaven and in heaven, but in the earth and from the earth.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:41851:78"/>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe it is not a nature, it is not deep, ſolid and laſting; it waſhes the outſide of the platter; makes new words, geſtures, expreſſions; but your confeſſions ſay, the heart is ſtill a moſt vile and filthy thing, and that your natures are ſtill cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: If the heart be unclean, Religion is but a ſhadow, and cannot pleaſe him who is truth and ſubſtance: He requires, a good man, that hath a good treaſure, in a good heart; and a good tree, of a right kind, that brings forth good fruit; not briers and thorns of contention and violence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Being not from heaven, it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts and decayes; it is not an <hi>incorruptible</hi> life: Actually it hath foully corrupted, into the groſſeſt pollutions, that any people did ever commit. Into groſs covetouſneſs, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and ſelf-ſeeking: into abſurd and palpable errours, lies and deluſions: And into that moſt, which is the worſt, enmity, cruelty and perſecution; and that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and univerſally, of all, both friends and foes, and in all, in the higheſt moſt: And therefore obſerve it, with a ſpecial obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the ſeveral parties, Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Independant, Anabaptiſts and fifth Monarchy-men: have all one life of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41851:78"/>one peace, one righteouſneſs, one hope, one heaven: Of each ſort, ſome died in the late execution; and they all breathed out their ſouls in one and the ſame faith and hope.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Yet theſe had been, not many Moneths before, mortal enemies one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and attempted war one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſome of them were for the Rump, againſt the Army; and ſome of them, for the Army, againſt the Rump: and the fifth Monarchy-men would gladly have fought them both, and have offered at it: and yet they appeared at laſt Brethren: And if they were reſtrained from fighting and drawing blood, yet their prayers, faith and religion, were ſet againſt one another: which hath been the conſtant practiſe of all theſe Parties; they have diſcharged bitter curſes and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt each other: which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt corruption, even to a diſſolution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And therefore if men allow of enmity againſt any ſort of men, becauſe they are againſt them, and their wayes; they will exerciſe the ſame to all that oppoſe their way: He that will kill a Cavaleer, becauſe he is not godly, will likewiſe kill a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Independant, Anabaptiſt, or any other, if he croſs his way and notion; be he never

               <p>Fourthly, This kind of corruption of a body or ſociety of people, into deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and exerciſe of their ſpirits and gifts againſt each other, is the worſt kind of corruption that can be of Holineſs or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Becauſe 1. it is againſt love, which is the ſupream Law. 2. It tends to a diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand; if not a Civil, then much leſs a Religious Kingdom. 3. Where this ſin is, all others are alſo: <hi>For where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work,</hi> Jam. 3.16. Therefore <hi>if you have bitter envying and ſtrife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not againſt the truth: This wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom deſcendeth not from above;</hi> but is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſenſual and deviliſh, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>The wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle and eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocriſie,</hi> ver. 17.</p>
               <p>From all which we muſt conclude, that the Religion and Holineſs in which you <hi>glory,</hi> and upon which you ſtand, <hi>is earthly and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41851:79"/>ſenſual;</hi> It began in ſtrife and ſelf-ſeeking; and its end is deviliſh: It is corrupted and faln: As great and greater things then theſe, have corrupted, the Scripture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes it: I teſtifie it, upon experimental knowledge: and your works manifeſt this of yours to be faln: If you <hi>glory</hi> in this, and think there is not a better, <hi>you lie againſt the truth,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith: I know there is a more excellent, heavenly and perfect ſtate, which now judges this of yours, and you will know it alſo, when you are aſhamed of this.</p>

               <p>LEt me mind you what we are upon. <hi>He that hateth his Brother, is in darkneſs, walketh in darkneſs, and knoweth not whither he goeth, becauſe darkeneſs hath blinded his eyes:</hi> I am proving that the darkneſs of hatred hath blinded your eyes, that you know not, 1. What you are: 2. What your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are: 3. What the way is you are going, or whither you go: You are blinded, as to your ſelves, and in a miſt of ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion have loſt, 1. your Cauſe, 2. your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: you retain the form or carkaſs of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41851:80"/>both, but have loſt the juſtice of one, and the life of the other: I ſhall now ſhew you how you are blinded concerning your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; that you do not, cannot underſtand them, in the preſent ſtate in which you ſtand.</p>
               <p>I will not urge upon you my apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, which I have declared in my Book: They are there publiſhed, and let them abide the tryal: I meet with nothing yet, that is of ſufficient authority to make me retract them: You wonder and are offended at the good that I have written of the King, from thoſe antient foundations of <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>grace, in Gods ſight,</hi> laid in <hi>Noah:</hi> My authority for it I tell you, <hi>pag.</hi> 65. in theſe words, <hi>My love is my firſt and chief guide, in this application to your Majeſtie. I believe it will uphold and juſtifie me, againſt that weakneſs or ſtrangeneſs, which either is in it, or may ſeem to others to be in it: For I do in my ſoul, give unto love, the moſt abſolute authority, as the moſt ſupream royal Law in heaven and in earth; the moſt certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rule: For that only is without errour, that is able to cover the errours, and ſupply the defects of all things elſe.</hi> I only advance it as a ſtandard, let it ſtand naked by it ſelf: I do it to invite you to deal with it: Both
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41851:80"/>reaſon and ſenſe are againſt it: Overthrow it if you can; I do deſire it may be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tryed: becauſe I know it is a ſtranger in the world: You have other thoughts of this application, that it comes from the vile and baſe principle of flattery: I profeſs the moſt honourable principle of love; if you have I any ſtrength of truth and righteouſneſs in you, ſuffer not ſo groſs an evil as this to paſs uncorrected.</p>
               <p>My buſineſs with you, is to ſlay that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that is in you, to the preſent power; and to take you off from that dangerous oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which you are engaged: that ſo you may come to <hi>live a quiet and ſober life under it:</hi> And to let you ſee how <hi>hatred hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No man that hates ought to judge; while he hates he cannot judge: All paſſions darken the judgement; above all hatred, which is a foul, black, deviliſh thing; it is of <hi>the wicked one:</hi> whom God hath caſt down from all authority of rule and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And made him a ſlave, a vile Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of his wrath: I pleaded this in my Book, in the behalf of them that ſince have ſuffered, <hi>pag.</hi> 152. and now plead it with you: And ſhall I hope never ceaſe to plead it with God, and with men: and with God
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41851:81"/>in man, till this baſe ſpirit of malice, be caſt out of all power, both Civil and Religious: For I know that hatred, though it ſeem to judge, and to be very forward in judging, yet it hath neither true right, nor light to judge any: Only it is a ſervant to the juſtice of God: It is true, God hath given this beaſt a kingdom, greatneſs and power, but it is only in wrath and deſtruction: Fooliſh man is deceived miſerably by him, poor duſt, if he can get up into any kind of power; though it be only to plague and deſtroy, yet he thinks it a great attainment: if he hath ſo much knowledge, religion or power, as to inflict puniſhment, he fancies himſelf a god: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he adminiſters divine diſpleaſure: But if ever you come to ſo much light of God, as to know what you do, you will abhor your ſelves for that, which you now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in.</p>
               <p>If you will ſhew your ſelves men, and but exerciſe your reaſon, you will quickly ſee, that you cannot judge of your enemies that you hate, and therefore that they are not what you judge them to be, while you judge in hatred.</p>
               <p>Firſt, No man can judge, when he hates, or after he hates: For when men hate, they ſuppoſe, thoſe they hate, are to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41851:81"/>and therefore they are already judged and condemned: For hatred is the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of one condemned, and that with the worſt condemnation: unto the utmoſt and irrevocable ruine: Men think when they hate, there remains nothing to do, but to proſecute, to utter deſtruction; to ſpoil, pull down, ſhame, diſgrace and ruine them: And it is impoſſible that they ſhould judge, that are thus employed to execute: For to judge a perſon, or a thing, is to try the good and the evil; all judgement ſuppoſes a right and a wrong, and an indifferency to both, with an endeavour to find out both: Now conſider how you are affected to your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and you will find that you do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely hate them as perſons and things to be cut off from the earth: As <hi>the people of Gods wrath,</hi> and <hi>of his curſe:</hi> as enemies to Jeſus Chriſt, doomed to deſtruction for ever: So that judgement is paſt, if this be your minds; and you have nothing to do but to ſeek their ruine.</p>
               <p>As you ſee you cannot judge, till you ceaſe to hate, ſo you may here ſee the nature and kind of hatred: When God hath judged a people to be ſcourged and ſpoiled for their ſins, and given them up to <hi>wrath</hi> and the <hi>curſe;</hi> he hath inſtruments prepared for the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41851:82"/>execution of them, ſome; fierce, ſelf-ſeeking, hating perſons; To theſe he diſcovers the Sentence, and repreſents the Party to be puniſhed, as cloathed with his Curſe; and then they fall on, with all their zeal and might, as glad of ſuch employment: But poor wretches, they know not the counſel of God, not the meaſure nor end of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: And therefore form up other conceits in their heads, as the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> did: <hi>Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo, but it is in his heart to deſtroy and cut off Nations not a few, Iſa.</hi> 10.7. Succeſs in ſuch employments are certain and conſtant; which the proud Executioner cannot bear, but his <hi>hatred</hi> is <hi>enlarged as hell,</hi> and preſently thinks of <hi>deſtroying Nations not a few;</hi> glorying in the ſucceſs, he is ſwelled with pride, and thinks to conquer all the world: This is only to ſhew you the true original and nature of hatred; it is rooted in the Curſe of God, and in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the great miniſter of the Curſe, who hath power of death: he ſets man on to execute the Curſe, and then inflames him into high thoughts of himſelf, for his work: What a mercy it will be for poor man to be redeemed from this vile ſervice, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and woful errors, that do attend it.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:41851:82"/>
               <p>To return to our purpoſe; while you hate, you cannot judge of them you hate: and the judgement you make is no judgement, or a falſe one. For,</p>
               <p>Secondly, You did judge them <hi>Babylon, Antichriſtian</hi> enemies; and that therefore their judgement was <hi>for ever and ever:</hi> Such you know is the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon, as a Mill-ſtone caſt into the Sea,</hi> as the Angel ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>and be found no more at all: The voice of Harps and Muſitians ſhall not be found in her, nor the light of a candle, nor the voice of the Bridegroom,</hi> &amp;c. So you thought of theſe, that they would never recover more: And now you ſee the <hi>Muſick,</hi> and the <hi>Candles,</hi> and the <hi>Mirth</hi> is riſen again out of the Sea, and hath eſcaped the <hi>mill-ſtone</hi> and the drowning too: Now <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> and conſider: You judged them <hi>Babylon,</hi> and therefore to be deſtroyed <hi>for ever:</hi> but now you find it otherwiſe: your judgement therefore is falſe: Had they been what you imagined them, they had never roſe: Or had you or your judgement been true, they had never recovered, nor you faln: if you erred as to the kind of the puniſhment, you erred alſo as to their ſtate: I know you muſt think, that this recovery of theirs, is but in order to an utter and final
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41851:83"/>deſtruction: And the reaſon of it is, becauſe if you do think it otherwiſe, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all your prayers, praiſes, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Scriptures, that you have made for your ſelves and againſt them a long time: Therefore till you repent of them, you muſt believe your enemies muſt periſh, be it never ſo irrational: For they cannot be juſtified, till your enemies do fall, they being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their ruine: But pray conſider, this is a preſent ſhift, and but a ſhift: It will not cover your ſhame: It is far eaſier to confeſs ten errours, ten years errours, the errours of ten thouſand perſons, then to juſtifie one errour: Be you never ſo good, great, and many, you are but men; you may err, you have erred and run out of one errour into another, many years together: <hi>He</hi> againſt <hi>whom</hi> you have exclaimed, <hi>delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, deluſion;</hi> is able to ſay to you now, You have been and are under <hi>ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> I have thought it, and publiſhed it, and now it is proved to be ſo.</p>
               <p>If ever it come to paſs, as you expect, an utter and final deſtruction of your enemies; it muſt be by a ſpirit, that is more holy, true, and righteous, then that, in which you have hitherto acted: And ſuch a ſpirit you cannot have, till you repent of the former:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41851:83"/>I ſhall help you what I can. An utter and final deſtruction will come, and now is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun upon all wicked and ungodly works; although it be not ſeen and felt: <hi>for all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked works are in the wicked one, and he in the wrath of God: in which he and they ſhall lie for ever:</hi> All <hi>his works</hi> will be deſtroyed, in judgement, for this fire will deſtroy <hi>his works,</hi> and ſave <hi>the perſons:</hi> But your ſpirit, or the ſpirit in which you acted, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>things;</hi> but did encreaſe <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs;</hi> for both your ſelves, and enemies alſo, are not better, but worſe by what you have adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I hope you will now confeſs, that you and your Party are worſe then you thought you were: If you are worſe then you judged, why ſhould you not think that your enemies are better then you judged? If you are not ſuch holy, bleſſed, heavenly Saints, as you thought you were, then by the Law of contraries, they are not ſuch Devils, or brats of Antichriſt, as you conceived them. If you are weak men, as it appears you are, then your judgement of them is like your ſelves, weak and fallible: And as you fall from your Mountain of exaltation, ſo muſt they riſe, and ſtand upon even ground with you; and be like your ſelves, weak ſinful men as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41851:84"/>you are: If you are not quite void of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and reaſon, you cannot but admit, that they have ſome good in them; becauſe there is ſo much evil in you that have oppoſed them: If there was ſo much folly, giddineſs, and drunkenneſs in your oppoſition; you cannot but think, that there is ſome good in theſe that you oppoſe: As I do admit that there was ſome good in you that did oppoſe, ſome evil in them: ſo you muſt admit, that evil in you, and that evil oppoſition that you made, muſt be againſt ſomething good in them; For evil where ever it is, it fights againſt good.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if there were no good in them, and no evil in you; you need not, you would not oppoſe them; for that which is perfectly good, is above all oppoſition, And that which is perfectly evil, is below it; <hi>That</hi> lives in a heaven in it ſelf; <hi>this</hi> in hell and confuſion; <hi>that</hi> is ſalvation and reſt in it ſelf, <hi>this</hi> is destruction, and ſinks under the weight of its own ſhame and guilt.</p>
               <p>Moſt of you that have had any light or ſenſe of things, have of late found a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Antichriſt,</hi> which is within. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction was but late upon you, and but weak, and therefore you have poſſibly now loſt the ſight of this enemy in you: But there he is,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41851:84"/>and will be found, out: This <hi>ſpiritual An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> was in you from the beginning of your work, though he appeared but lately: And being in you, he did work with you, pray with you, fight with you, proteſt and covenant with you, was in all your zeal, judgings, faſtings and engagements: You never had any thing pure or clean without him: If this be indeed <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he is, <hi>the Antichriſt;</hi> for <hi>ſpiritual Antichriſt,</hi> is greater then <hi>fleſhly Antichriſt;</hi> more dangerous, wicked and malicious: The nature of this <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is to oppoſe <hi>Chriſt;</hi> he doth it conſtantly, and cannot do otherwiſe: Then if he hath been in you, and acted in you; in your <hi>wars</hi> and <hi>works;</hi> he hath oppoſed <hi>Chriſt</hi> in thoſe <hi>wars</hi> and <hi>works:</hi> And then, there muſt be ſomething of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in them that you oppoſe: I ſhall ſtill help you what I can: This <hi>ſpiritual Antichriſt</hi> hath oppoſed <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Firſt in your own ſpirits; and ſlain that Lamb, meekneſs, innocency, and love in you, and ſet up a proud, cruel, bloody ſpirit, in the worſhip of God, and in you his ſemple. Secondly, this <hi>ſpiritual Antichriſt</hi> made you fierce and cruel to your Brethren, that d ffered from you. And thirdly, it made you falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cruel and unmerciful to your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41851:85"/>not admitting them to the common favour and mercy which God ſhews to all men.</p>
               <p>My intent is, by levelling the lofty confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of men, to bring them nearer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo to prepare them for peace and reconciliation: <hi>All have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God: God hath concluded</hi> and <hi>ſhut up together, all men,</hi> in one pit of darkneſs and enmity, <hi>that he might have mercy upon all,</hi> that none may glory, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt themſelves, one over another: None are righteous; nor ſaved, becauſe they are righteous; nor ſhall any be deſtroyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſinners: for therefore are <hi>all ſhut up,</hi> in one <hi>pit:</hi> that mercy may bring them all forth: If any be worſe then others, it is they that have moſt knowledge, and ſinned againſt greateſt favour: And they may again receive moſt mercy; for <hi>where ſin hath abounded, Grace ſhall much more abound:</hi> They that are firſt humbled, will firſt ſee and partake of this large, excellent and eternal ſalvation: Therefore my friends, be not ſtout againſt the Lord, but fall under his rebuke: <hi>Of pride comes contention:</hi> If you be truly humbled, you will ceaſe to ſtrive: You have been as <hi>Capernaum, exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to heaven,</hi> in gifts, ſucceſs, titles, names,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41851:85"/>expreſſions, and are now <hi>brought down to hell:</hi> not only to outward ſhame and lofs, but to the filth, lies, pride and enmity of <hi>hell:</hi> Who can deny the moſt high this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, to ſet up as high as <hi>heaven,</hi> in the brightneſs and glory of a Miniſtry; and bring down again to the blackneſs and foulneſs of <hi>hell?</hi> Shall fooliſh man think, that becauſe God dreſſes him up, and calls him forth, to ſerve him, he cannot again reject that man and his ſervice alſo? Or becauſe he makes things honourable, at leaſt in mans eſteem, that he ſhall not again diſhonour them? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay; to form it a veſſel of honour, or diſhonour? Hath he not power, to faſhion it for a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, employ it in that ſervice; and then break it in pieces, and make it new again?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that knows not himſelf, knows nothing truly; for all wiſdom begins at the knowledge of our ſelves: We know nothing, till we know our ſelves: And we know nothing fully, till we know it in our ſelves. We know nothing rightly, till we our ſelves rightly meaſured, are the meaſure of others:</hi> It is apparent, you are miſtaken in your ſelves and in your work; and therefore thoſe unexpected cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of diviſion, envy, covetouſneſs and ſelf ſeeking are broken forth and diſcovered:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41851:86"/>After thoſe corruptions, unexpected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions: After thoſe confuſions, unexpected ruine and deſtruction is upon you: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have over-valued your ſelves: And they that over-value themſelves, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily undervalue their enemies: One can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without the other: Moſt men, their righteouſneſs is of that nature; they are good, becauſe others are worſe: Enemies can no longer think themſelves good, then they think their enemies wicked: And therefore men are neceſſitated, when they become enemies to any, to aggravate their evils, all that they can; to feed and ſatisfie their own anger at them: and not only to think them evil, but to rejoyce when their evil appears, either of ſin or puniſhment; which ſhews the vile nature of enmity, it engages a mans ſoul to miſchief; it makes men ſtudy it, long for it, thirſt after it; and if it comes not, his hatred ſtirs him and pricks him on, both to think it, to ſpeak it, to pray for it, and to act it as much as he can.</p>
               <p>Therefore conſider your ſelves: you have read <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. <hi>That which is highly eſteemed amongst men, is an abomination in the ſight of God.</hi> You highly eſteemed your work and ſtate: It is become <hi>abominable</hi> in the <hi>ſight of men;</hi> in part, in your <hi>own
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41851:86"/>ſight:</hi> It was firſt ſo <hi>in Gods ſight:</hi> For if he had not <hi>abominated</hi> it, it had not faln into that vile ſtate, in which it now lies under guilt, ſhame and loſs.</p>
               <p>Conſider then, if <hi>that which is highly eſteemed by men, may be abominable in the ſight of God;</hi> may not that alſo which men have <hi>abominated,</hi> become <hi>highly eſteemed of God?</hi> Yea, is it not alwayes ſo? What men reject, God chuſes: <hi>The baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea and things that are not, that he might bring to naught things that are,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.28. And for this reaſon, <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>that no fleſh might glory in his preſence:</hi> If one Party only ſhould be accepted, as ſometimes it is for a ſeaſon; then doth that Party <hi>glory in his preſence;</hi> as you did in the time of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation: Now God rejects you, and chuſes them whom you ſcorned; Yet they muſt not be happy alone; for God will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon all.</p>
               <p>It were no diſhonour to you, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs and reconciliation ſhould begin in you: To prepare you for it, are you brought down from your confidence? You laid all the evil upon your adverſaries, and now muſt be content to bear ſhame with them: You are not the only <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Zion;</hi> nor
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41851:87"/>they the only <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and <hi>Babylon:</hi> You have found an <hi>Antichriſt within,</hi> and he is worſe then one without: A <hi>ſpiritual An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> is worſe then a <hi>fleſhly Antichriſt:</hi> Their Religion is corrupt, and not pure: Hath not yours alſo been corrupted with the worſt kind of corruption, malice and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie? Theirs is clogged with outward pomp, worldly honour: Yours was ſo awhile. But theirs was given by blind ſuperſtitious people: And yours was taken by force of arms: But their Religion is not according to Scripture: nor is any form of Religion, now in the Nation: All build ſomething of their own, and therefore they differ: None are exactly according to the pattern of the Apoſtles, neither in form nor power.</p>
               <p>As all are ſharers in the evil, ſo in the good alſo: You are not Angels of light; nor they Devils; you are all <hi>men;</hi> Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, weak and ſinful men: You have <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal gifts,</hi> but an <hi>ill ſtate:</hi> They have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal defects; they have a better ſtate; an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at leaſt: They are upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Law; whether ſpiritually or no, is the queſtion: It is not with you, it may he found among them: You have ſuffered, they have ſuffered: But they are not better
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41851:87"/>by ſufferings: It is well this is an objection; for by this there appears an expectation that they ſhould mend: Nor are you better by mercies: And mercies, are more Goſpel and effectual means of Grace, then judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>Iſrael</hi> was puniſhed, and was worſe by it, and yet not utterly rejected: You ſuffered for conſcience, ſo did they: But their ſufferings are not for a pure conſcidence; neither are yours purely for conſcience: Not only <hi>for well-doing;</hi> there is a mixture in both yours and theirs.</p>
               <p>There is great reaſon, why you ſhould come to know one another, for one Party ſucceeds another, and is content to let the other be their rule and pattern.</p>
               <p>You learned of your enemies, lordlinſes, gentility, wayes and forms of ſtate, of greatneſs: they come after you, and learn your wayes, of finding plots, diſturbing meetings, diſcountenancing, diſgracing, impriſoning Adverſaries: They are, and do now, where you were, and as you did, not long ſince: They ride upon you, as you rode upon them: They cruſh you, as you cruſhed them: You afflicted and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, they do the ſame things to you: Muſt not the word of Chriſt be fulfilled? <hi>Mat. 7.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Judge not, that you be not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41851:88"/>For with what judgement you judge, you ſhall be judged: And with what meaſure you mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again:</hi> This I declared to you, when you began this judging and oppreſſing way; that it would return upon you; you would not bear then; will you underſtand now? Then know this, and let all men learn by it.

Secondly, God acts and rules in all mens ſpirits in theſe things, and that juſtly, and therefore be not wrathful againſt them, but ſubmit to God in it: The <hi>Lord hath ſaid Curſe.</hi> Thirdly, And may we not ſay, (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28.) <hi>They are enemies for your ſakes, but as touching the election, they are beloved for the Fathers ſake:</hi> It is for your ſakes that they are acted thus againſt you, to make you ſenſible of the work you have done: What a <hi>goodly thing</hi> it is to ride upon men; and to watch over them for evil? When you come to a right ſenſe and repentance of that work and ſpirit, you yet glory in, then will that ſpirit ceaſe to afflict you; becauſe it is <hi>for your ſakes:</hi> For God delighteth not in afflicting: If he doth ſend evil, it is for good: As it is the juſt fruit of your own doings; ſo certainly will
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41851:88"/>repentance remove it: Be not therefore angry at the hand, but feel <hi>the ſtaff of Gods indignation in their hand:</hi> And when you come to mourn over your ſelves, that you have been ſo acted; your will pitty them that ſucceed you, in that kind of employment: For it muſt be found on all ſides, to be but a ſad ſervice, to be a tormentor of others: And when you come to pitty them, that they ſhould be made <hi>enemies for your ſakes;</hi> that they ſhould be made a rod, becauſe you want chaſtening; and be that rod to you, that you were to them: You will then ſee, that <hi>both</hi> you and <hi>they are beloved for the Fathers ſake;</hi> neither for your own ſakes: And may alſo ſee, that they have a good root, and will bring forth better fruit in its ſeaſon: When we are fit to partake of it.</p>

               <p>HAtred ſo blinds men, that they know not themſelves, nor their enemies: It makes men worſe then otherwayes they would be, and yet to think better of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then ever they were: It makes men think their enemies worſe then they are; and it makes thoſe enemies worſe then they would be: And therefore the <hi>third thing</hi> follows, they that hate their Brethren, <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath blinded their eyes, and they know not whither they go:</hi> Enmity is of the Devil, and he is in darkneſs, <hi>God hath with-held light from him;</hi> he hath neither the light of Chriſt, nor of Angels, no nor of men: All his wayes, and all the wayes of men that are acted in his ſpirit, are moſt irrational and abſurd things: All men, ſo far as they are led by malice, are hurried, and driven, by the wrath of God, blowing up their paſſions, unto unreaſonable things, without any judgement or underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Let us look back upon our wars: Did any of us know, when we begun, <hi>whither we ſhould go?</hi> or did we once dream or imagine the things we have ſince done? and the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41851:89"/>ſtrange paths we have trodden? Have we not been driven beyond all our purpoſes, Declarations and Vows, into crooked and contrary wayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which our Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion did at firſt condemn; and will again, when we recover either the one or the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Was there ever ſuch a heap of inconſiſtencies and independencies? ſuch a maſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in Church and ſtate? And if we were blinded then, we are ſo ſtill, if we perſiſt: For we are not better, but worſe now, then at firſt; we have multiplied notions and opinions, but have decayed, both in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and love: We were then more ſimple, more moderate, and leſs guilty and bloody. And are now more enraged, more hardened, and more polluted; Therefore the further we go in this way, the worſe we are, and the deeper ſhall we plunge our ſelves in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
               <p>The whole Party that ſtand out in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the preſent Governors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Nation, are divided in all things; and in the kind or degree at leaſt of their enmity: Some are more groſs and carnal, and thirſt for war and blood: but many are taken off in part, from hopes of any good by war, but yet their ſpirits are ſtill in enmity; preaching againſt, praying
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41851:90"/>againſt, or curſing, reviling and condemning them, as enemies to God and his people; and denouncing and expecting judgements from heaven againſt them.</p>
               <p>Both theſe are of the ſame nature, are from the ſame root or fountain, and will, If there be occaſion, fall into the ſame Channel: Indeed all <hi>ſtrife</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> though it be but <hi>in the heart,</hi> yet it is in the judgement of the holy Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> chap. 3.15. <hi>earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh:</hi> And therefore it doth darken, pollute and defile the ſoul: And by how much more inward or ſeeming ſpiritual it is, it is by ſo much the more dangerous; becauſe more <hi>deviliſh:</hi> And being ſo, no man can command it; it will maſter every mind in which it is, and lead him at laſt to carnal wayes, if it be not outwardly reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: 'For he that will curſe, will alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy: And he that doth the greater, what ſhould hinder him to do the leſs? They that condemn men to Satan and to hell, they will hardly forbear killing of them, if they have power and opportunity: or doing ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as their hatred directs them to.</p>
               <p>The root of all this is the <hi>Serpent: Out of the Serpents root, comes forth a Cockatrice, and his fruit a fiery flying Serpent:</hi> from this <hi>root</hi> the <hi>Serpent</hi> ſhoots forth this hiſſing

                  </gap>n all men, the <hi>Devil:</hi> And finding, that he hath at laſt taken Sanctuary in Religion, and the profeſſion thereof; and hath therein acted with ſo much vigor and ſecurity: I muſt purſue him into your heart and ſpirits: It is his main fort; Zeal for God and his Cauſe: if we can heat him hence, we ſhall hope to drive him out of the earth: For if this hold, be taken from him, he will have very little ſtrength to make reſiſtance any where elſe: That this enemy is amongſt you, we have ſufficient, proof: We follow him by a train of blood, and by the track of all the beaſts his companions; pride, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, falſhood, ſelf-ſeeking: And we ſee the ſmoak of his confuſion, and hear the noiſe of his violence among you: Therefore you muſt endure to be aſſaulted and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know it will coſt you dear, it will ſhake the whole frame and foundation of your Religion, to have him quite deſtroyed in you; it did ſo in me; his root lies deep: But if you can bear the tryal, and become free from this ſoul enemy your perſons
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41851:91"/>and gifts will ſhine in the true and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory of the <hi>Lamb of God:</hi> Poſſibly you may have the honour of yielding up and ſlaying the laſt and greateſt ſtrength of this enemy of mankind.</p>
               <p>I am ſatisfied that the <hi>horns</hi> of his <hi>beaſtly</hi> power are both ſawn off, and ſcattered: And that the <hi>Lamb of God</hi> is conqueror; and doth begin already to bud and ſpring forth in many perſons, who do abhor the filth and deceit of war, blood and wrath: And do ſee that nothing ſprings from thence, but miſchief and confuſion: To help forward the birth of this ſpirit of love, and to guide <hi>your feet in a way of peace;</hi> have I engaged in this diſcourſe: It will be an honourable and laſting conqueſt to overcome him: He hath betrayed and ſpoyled all other your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts: Now we ſhall be revenged on him: and <hi>deſtroy him,</hi> who hath <hi>deſtroyed</hi> by you; and then <hi>deſtroyed</hi> you alſo.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe there is a rich treaſure of life, righteouſneſs, and holineſs, hid in the nature of man: Yea I know it, and am one with it: Even the very <hi>Kingdom of God is amongst us and in us:</hi> This rich treaſure hath come forth in profeſſion name and propheſie, in your ſpirits: But it hath miſcarried and faln ſhort: This is certainly from this <hi>evil
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41851:91"/>one;</hi> it is he that hath done you this michief: And it is he amongſt your ſelves: For an open enemy could not hurt you, could not ſtand before you: It is he that hath betrayed you: His great ſtrength lies in <hi>enmity,</hi> whereby he brings darkneſs, <hi>confuſion and every evil work:</hi> You know, confuſion and enmity, divided, diſtracted and ruined you: What need we any plainer evidence? Therefore it muſt be enmity and hatred that hath deſtroyed you: And it muſt be victory againſt him and it, that muſt ſave you: We have already ſhewed you, that hatred, though it begin againſt thoſe that are further off, yet it will not ſtay there: If it be admitted, it will reign. He that will hate any man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he differs from him, or becauſe he is ſinful; will hate his neareſt friend, becauſe he may and doth differ, and is ſinful: He that to preſerve himſelf and his own way of Religion, will deſtroy a <hi>Cavaleer,</hi> will upon the ſame ground, deſtroy a <hi>Presbyterian, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant</hi> or <hi>Quaker;</hi> and conſequently all that oppoſe him: Indeed, <hi>he that will not ſuffer for ſinners, for enemies, muſt reſolve to kill all ſinners and enemies, or all that will not conform to him:</hi> Therefore it is the ſame <hi>enmity,</hi> wherewith you proſecuted your firſt enemies and your brethren: the very ſame
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41851:92"/>violence and ſelf-love, that enraged you againſt them, kept you from agreeing one with another: And the ſame conceits, that you were the <hi>people of God,</hi> and that yours was the <hi>only way of God;</hi> that made you abjure and renounce the King and Church: the very ſame opinion and confidence, made you oppoſe one another: Each man being confident, his own way, was the only way, made you unyielding one to another: <hi>For that which will not ſubmit to any thing, but what is Gods mind, and what he knows to be Gods mind, muſt neceſſarily oppoſe every man that differs from him:</hi> You know whereunto this tends: And therefore there can be no peace, but in that love, which can bear with that, which to him doth not appear to be Gods mind, or can ſubmit to them that do not in all things the holy and perfect will of God: And if we have ſo much love and pitty, as to bear them that do err in a little; if we have more love, we may bear them that err much: <hi>The truth is, we muſt either quarrel with all; or bear the weakneſs of all, in love to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore this enemy that hath abuſed you, and miſled you, into thoſe dark wayes in which you now he: Hitherto <hi>you have not known whither you have gone;</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41851:92"/>now by light, reaſon, and experience, not to follow him, who draws you into a ſnare, and there ſpoils you of your peace and ſafety.</p>
               <p>We ſuppoſe you are travelling towards the Kingdom of Chriſt: I believe you would ſee him upon the throne: The enemy tells you, Theſe men that you oppoſe, hinder him and his Kingdom; and that by their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Chriſt ſhall be exalted: You are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in quite out of the way to his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Firſt, While you ſeek to gain a Kingdom for him; you deny to acknowledge that Kingdom, which his Father hath already given him: He is <hi>ſet down upon his Fathers Throne:</hi> And that throne is everlaſting: You may therefore ſeek a Kingdom for your ſelves, but not for him; And in doing ſo, you do both deny, and reſiſt his Kingdom: And fight with him, becauſe he doth not ſet you up with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His Kingdom is firſt in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <hi>The Kingdom and patience of Jeſus:</hi> And a bleſſed Kingdom it is, to reſt in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They that are truly Kings with him, have the Kingdom in themſelves; and firſt enjoy it on the Croſs; <hi>triumphing there:</hi> They who by the riches of their natures, or by God in them, can enrich poverty, make
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41851:93"/>bonds free; that can live in death, love and bleſs enemies, they are fit to raign: For when ſuch come to the Kingdom, they will enrich, ſave, bleſs and do good to all, and hurt none: But they that cannot bear the worſt of evils among men, will themſelves be a burden to men, if they get to the throne: The good God who loves man, proves and tries his own <hi>Son,</hi> before he gives him the Kingdom: And will not commit the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to him, till he hath found that he can be happy without it: till he can <hi>glory</hi> on the Croſs: till he can die for others, and be more happy in laying down his life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for them, then in receiving honour from them: This <hi>Lamb</hi> doth overcome: For <hi>he is King of Kings:</hi> He hath the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in him, and therefore all Kingdoms in his nature: And needs not take from others, but gives to others: And <hi>they that are with him, are</hi> (as he is) <hi>called, faithful and choſen:</hi> They do partake of his royal nature, and are <hi>called,</hi> to ſuffer and to raign: And in both are <hi>faithful,</hi> and therefore <hi>choſen</hi> to it, they ſtrive not for it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That only is mighty, and ſhall raign, that hath power with God:</hi> They that will overcome any thing truly, muſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41851:93"/>him; becauſe <hi>his is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory:</hi> Now nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with him, but <hi>Lamb;</hi> abſolute and perfect ſubjection to him, hath only power with him: And therefore none ſhall or can raign with him; but they that will not reſiſt him, nor any power that he ſets up over them: For <hi>whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, Rom.</hi> 13.2. By this Chriſt overcame, and is <hi>ſet down upon the throne:</hi> And by the ſame <hi>Lamb,</hi> nature keeps what he got; for this only is invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and eternal: If you had all the force of <hi>England,</hi> and of the whole earth, yea of all the Angels; you could not keep it, it would all ruine and deſtroy it ſelf, if you had it not, in the <hi>Lamb:</hi> for nothing can poſſibly ſubſiſt in the <hi>nature of God,</hi> or upon the <hi>throne of God,</hi> but this meek, patient <hi>Lamb:</hi> For it is eternally ſubjected to God, and therefore he is eternally pleaſed with him, and eternally honours him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Lamb is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords:</hi> His Kingdom is on high, <hi>higher then the Kings of the earth;</hi> their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, riches, titles and honours are below him, they are his ſervants or children: And therefore he cannot ſet himſelf to oppoſe them; nor can any that have his ſpirit:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41851:94"/>Theſe low conteſts of war, are the buſineſs of earthly and ſenſual men; that live in the mire and dirt of the world; who are hurt and offended, with each others wayes and paſſions: But he is on high, and ſo are they that raign with him; beyond the reach of all theſe things: He is over them all; and gives theſe Kingdoms to whom he pleaſe: And when he hath given, will defend and protect in that gift, as long as he pleaſe, and in what way he pleaſe: And <hi>they that are with him, are called;</hi> to know what he doth, and do as he doth: Therefore if you ſeek for the Kingdom of Chriſt, you muſt aſcend by ſuffering, into this glory; from whence all men receive, all their honour, power and riches: And then you will ceaſe contending with that which he gives.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt is now in the exerciſe of his Kingdom upon you, and you are his ſubjects and ſervants; now under his rod and iron ſcepter: He hath brought you down, and ſet up thoſe that you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy: And is, you know, righteous and juſt in it: You are under the juſtice of his Kingdom; and the firſt true and pure ſenſe you ſhall have of his Kingdom, is of the wrath of it: You may talk of his glory, but muſt come to feel his anger, be pleaſed with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41851:94"/>it, ſubmit to it, and reſt in it, before you come to enjoy his love: This I can affirm upon certain knowledge and experience: That if you will not embrace and kiſs this his judgement, you ſhall never riſe higher, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaven nor in earth: Therefore know he raigns now in righteouſneſs, and give him that <hi>glory</hi> that is due to him; give him <hi>glory,</hi> by taking <hi>ſhame</hi> before all the world: That glory you may give him; and it is all the Kingdom you or any fleſh can give Chriſt, to ſuffer from him: But to think that as ſoon as you attain a notion of his Kingdom, and a weak one, that preſently you muſt have ſhare with him in it, is high preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: For man or fleſh, to think to have it with him, is to take it from him, if they could.</p>
               <p>Therefore you are miſerably deceived, by the Prince of darkneſs, and deluded by him: he would perſwade you, that you are for Chriſt and his Kingdom, when indeed it is for your ſelves and your own advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: You are perſwaded, that you would exalt him, and ſet him upon the Throne; whereas he is already upon the Throne, judging you and that carnal mind: You can give h m no Kingdom; you may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Kingdom he hath: Indeed if any
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41851:95"/>will give him a Kingdom, they muſt give of their own: If then you had a glory and a Kingdom, and could lay it down for him and to him; you might then be ſaid to exalt Chriſt: And ſo far as you can bear this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that you are under, and publickly juſtifie him, and condemn your ſelves and the ſtate and ſpirit, in which you ſtood and acted, as unworthy to ſtand up in his name and preſence: So far you will give him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and make him to be honoured and feared in the world: Could you and I come forth, and openly declare, that God may uſe us, and all men, and all our Zeal and Religion, in what ſervice he pleaſe: But that he will not ſuffer, either us, or any other to raign with him: ſo long as any thing of a private, ſelf-ſeeking, proud or cruel ſpirit remains in us: This lively and experimental teſtimony will make him to be honoured and feared. And ſhould I and you ſay and confeſs, that the bleſſed God, hath ſuch love to mankind, that he will ſuffer neither me nor you, to have place in his Church, till we can love and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all; and bear the ſins and curſe of all men: We ſhall thereby render him loved and honoured: For this indeed is, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes was his mind: he would not give the Kingdom to Jeſus, till he manifeſted this ſpirit
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41851:95"/>in him; neither did Chriſt deſire it upon any other terms: You may ſpeak and do as you will; but this is my ſenſe and experience: Therefore God hath brought me down, and made me taſte death again and again, becauſe he will not endure me to ſtand or to miniſter before his Throne, till I can bear and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all the folly and ſin of thoſe, to whom I miniſter: And till by frequent deaths, and rejection, he hath killed that root of enmity to men, that curſes them; and brought forth that love that can be accurſed for them; It is his way, it is his nature, he dealt ſo with Chriſt, and therefore muſt be juſtified and honoured for it: And ſo I do with my ſoul: And deſire office and employment in <hi>his Church,</hi> upon no other terms: Bleſſed for ever be his holy name for it, in my heart: And bleſſed be his name, in this Church and Nation: And let all <hi>his people</hi> ſay <hi>Amen:</hi> For he will eſtabliſh only ſuch miniſters over them in his houſe, as are of his, and his Sons mind and ſpirit.</p>
               <p>God may and doth for a time employ other ſpirits, to do baſer ſervices, to break, afflict and puniſh, ſo long as there is proud fleſh to be ſubdued: But none ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to miniſter healing, life and ſalvation, but ſuch as are of this ſpirit: The form or
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41851:96"/>title is title, and the queſtion is not great, who or which? But this is the Nature and Spirit choſen of God, to rule his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Let me aſſure you, under the word and oath of <hi>Jeſus: Verily, verily, except you be born again, you cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.3. Except you be born out of this earthly, ſenſual darkneſs, into heavenly light; out of this heatheniſh or legal ſpirit, into the largeneſs of heaven; you cannot ſo much as <hi>ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> ſo long as you think that it conſiſts in a multitude of prayers, in the opening of Scriptures, in fleſhly ſtriving for earthly liberty, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power; you do not, you cannot ſee the <hi>Kingdom of God:</hi> Alas, you admire your ſelves, your zeal and intentions, your gifts and notions; But what are thoſe to the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt? which is over all things in heaven, in earth, and under the earth: Over all things, firſt in heaven, He employes innumerable Angels, and all their holineſs, power and light, in diſtinct ages and places: And brings them forth ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, to act their parts, and to ſhew the utmoſt of their ſtrength and wiſdom in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the world: And when he hath done with them, <hi>folds them up as a veſture,</hi> layes
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41851:96"/>them aſide, and changes them for others: Poſſibly all that you have attained to, may not amount tb one Angel: Be it what it will, you cannot but confeſs, one Angel may do as much and more, know as much and more, ſpeak as much and more, then all you have done: And that in greater holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, purity, brightneſs and majeſty: And when he hath done it, muſt bow down and be diſmiſſed: Why then ſhould you be troubled at the fall of your works? Secondly, Chriſts Kingdom extends to all men, in all Nations: He hath power to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and anoint all men, with what ſpirit he pleaſe, to ſanctifie them and gift them; either as heathens, ſo he did <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his <hi>Medes;</hi> or as Jews, ſo he did <hi>Saul;</hi> or as Chriſtians, ſo he did the Saints of old: And yet none of them muſt raign, only miniſter, and ſerve in thoſe ſpirits. He hath laid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite variety of gifts in mans nature, and knows how to uſe them all, and will have a <hi>time for every purpoſe:</hi> And as he will draw out the good of every man, of what degree ſoever; ſo the evil of every man: All mens luſts and corruptions, muſt be drawn out and judged: <hi>In one ſtate</hi> of things, mens Religion and Gifts lie uppermoſt, and cover their ſins; that Religion muſt have a time
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41851:97"/>to work, and have honour or reward for that work; and when it is worn out, it muſt, as an old garment, be laid aſide. And then that evil that is under that form of Godlineſs, muſt be ſeen, ſhewed forth and puniſhed: <hi>In another ſtate,</hi> the good may lie under the evil: God hath a work and an object prepared for that evil; when its work is done, then the good will riſe, and have its time and place. Thirdly, As Chriſt rules all Angels and men, ſo all Devils, all infernal ſpirits, and will bring them forth, out of the bottomleſs pit, into his own <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> and give them their time and place, to ſhew forth all the evil that is in them: And thereby judge them, and then caſt them into the Lake of fire for ever: And there are various ſorts and kinds of <hi>fleſh,</hi> or humane weakneſs, for them to feed upon, in the nature of man: What is theirs, they do challenge, and muſt have; firſt for words and actions, and then for ſhame and puniſhment: And if we do in the leaſt, <hi>ſee the Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> we ſhall be content to take our lot in any of theſe, or in all of them, as it pleaſes God to diſpoſe of us: If your minds were enlarged into the ſight and view of the greatneſs of the Kingdom of God, and the continuance
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41851:97"/>of it in all ages, everlaſtingly, you would, with ſubmiſſion and joy conſider, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the preſent works of God upon your ſelves and upon the Nation: But ſo long as you are ſhut up in that narrow ſpirit, and limit the Kingdom of Chriſt, to ſuch a poor, inconſiderable, temporary thing, as your preſent diſpenſation and ſervice, you cannot underſtand any thing of it: Therefore know, that you are in darkneſs, and know not whither you go; you are quite out of the way to Chriſts Kingdom.</p>

               <p>Secondly, As it is ſhort in its kind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to anſwer the <hi>perfect and good will of God,</hi> either in your own ſouls, or upon the Nation; ſo it is corrupted, openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, and for guilt rejected: Becauſe <hi>it is polluted, it is not your reſt:</hi> To abide and perſiſt in a way and ſtate diſowned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by God; is not only ſloth and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but unbelief and diſobedience: God never pulls down one diſpenſation, but he provides another: If you were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in your ſelf-righteouſneſs, and your
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41851:98"/>minds not captivated by Satan; the very principles of holineſs that are in you, would make you diſtaſte your preſent ſtate, which hath been proved to be vain and falſe, and full of oppoſition and contradiction: There is in you a ſeed of truth, love, and purity, which muſt make you loath that ſtate that hath been and is found by conſtant experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, unclean, formal, and full of enmity to one another and all men: However you judge of me, as unholy, I muſt te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l you, I have a long time, not only witneſſed againſt the corruption of it, but have turned from it; even from the beſt of what is abroad, of every ſect: And that in the ſincerity of my love and affection, to the pure and holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Jeſus Chriſt: And ſo far as I have in any ſmall meaſure partaked of his holy Spirit; I have born your iniquities, and been preſſed and burdened with them, grieved for them, and ſhamed of them: I do not now blame you from a common or humane ſpirit, though that alſo is able to find groſs defects in you, and in the beſt of your way: It is by it, men blame you: And you by it, blame one another: But from that holineſs, wherewith I ſtand before God for you; and in that love and pitty to you, wherein I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for you, and could lay down my life for
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41851:99"/>you: I may ſay more; For I know and find that none comes unto the Father to intercede for ſinners, but by the Son: both in the name and ſpirit of the Son: None miniſter truly before God; but in that love of Chriſt, who can be accurſed for Brethren.</p>
               <p>From deep experience of God, of my own ſoul, and of your ſtate, and from a long and ſore travel in all, do I write this to you: That whatever you account of your ſelves, by <hi>comparing your ſelves with your ſelves;</hi> or with one another, or with them that are viſibly worſe then you: Yet when you ſhall but <hi>ſtrive to enter into the ſtrait gate,</hi> that you may indeed come into the Kingdom of God, and his naked face and preſence: I ſay, when you ſhall but ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in truth deſire it, and preſs after it: you will abhor your ſelves, and that kind of holineſs in which you now live: Yea I know in your approaches to God, which are not ſpiritual, naked and heavenly, but earthly, fleſhly, and in letter or image only; yet in that preſence of God, which you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, you are full of ſelf-condemnings, and ſelf-upbraidings: But that being but an <hi>out ward Court,</hi> into which your Religion brings you; it may ſhew you the outward ſpots and blemiſhes of your Religion, but
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41851:99"/>cannot diſcover to you, the root and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the evil that is in you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You are now, in a zeal for your forms of worſhip, and for thoſe gifts and graces that attend them; oppoſing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and reviling in words and religious exerciſes (to what that tends, all men know) the <hi>perſons, miniſtry</hi> and <hi>worſhip,</hi> now ſet up in the Nation: Againſt theſe you run headily and carnally; for conſider what you oppoſe, not Satan in theſe <hi>perſons, offices</hi> and <hi>worſhip,</hi> but the things themſelves: That which you oppoſe and ſight againſt, being outward and carnal, ſuch is that alſo by which you do oppoſe them: So that the buſineſs is, not to pull down ſin and iniquity, and ſet up holineſs; but to pull down the outward power, means and miniſtry of the Biſhop; and ſet up the Paſtor: In truth it is to pull down them, and ſet up your ſelves. This being a carnal and fleſhly conteſt, (though covered with the name of God.) 1. It is unclean. 2. And being unclean, that which comes from it muſt needs be unclean alſo: and thereby you promote, not holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but the contrary ſin: For contention and war have done, and ſtill do, wound and ſlay the holy life, which is pure and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and carnal ſtrife waſtes the meek and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41851:100"/>good ſpirit: If you ſhould attain what you aim at, and deſtroy again the whole out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward frame of Church and State, and ſet up your ſelves; except you had the holy and mighty Spirit of God, to deſtroy the root and ſpirit, as well as the form, and to open hell, and ſhut them up for ever, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did Chriſts enemies; they would reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, as they have done: But ſuch a Spirit and ſuch a Power you have not; I ſuppoſe if you could damn them all to hell preſently, you would not do it; you have more mercy in you, as men to men, your Brethren: And I am ſure, when you have power to do it, you will not do it; becauſe he that hath power to do it, will not, doth not do it: And he will never give his power, but he will give his goodneſs and mercy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>Again, if you could thruſt out them, and, exalt your ſelves and way in their place, how would holineſs be advanced? It would be but one thing removed, and another of the ſame nature brought in: for it is of the ſame kind with theirs; humane, earthly, and living in the ſame region, elſe it could not ſight with theirs: if it be but of the ſame earthly nature, it muſt needs be worſe, not better; becauſe it riſes by war, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41851:100"/>And therefore muſt needs be harder, ſharper, and more cruel; and thereby ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the ſofter; and attains its place by force: And yet when you have done this, except you have a more holy Spirit, to guide, lead and unite you; you will not be able to ſettle your ſelves.</p>
               <p>It is a tryed and judged caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this ſpirit in which you act, hath not that truth and power, that can wholly deſtroy what is; nor that love and light that can reform it; nor yet that wiſdom; that can provide a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And therefore, you did overturn this Government, throw it in the dirt, and leave the Nation void, for more wickedneſs to enter: and then ſuffer the old to recover, maimed and broken, into a fouler houſe then it was: Or elſe you muſt go on to perpetuate and eſtabliſh contention and confuſion in the Nation: This is both reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; and may convince you, if any thing will.</p>
               <p>If you have not a more holy, more true, and more excellent ſpirit, you can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what you ſeek; either an extirpation of this Power and Government, or eſtabliſh a better: If you cannot effect this, you will but ſill your ſelves, your Religion and the Nation, with violence, fury and enmity, by
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41851:101"/>all your oppoſition you make: But raiſe a deal of duſt, to blind your own eyes and others: But ſtir and provoke black and malignant ſpirits, both in you and againſt you, as you have done.</p>
               <p>And if you had that holy Spirit, which only can proſper you in ſuch an undertaking: Then I am ſure you would forbear this kind of carnal and wrathful oppoſition: For the ſpirit of Chriſt is of the nature of Chriſt, moſt holy and moſt gentle, gracious and merciful: He is ſo holy, pure and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, that he can and doth make theſe things, uphold them, and walk in them, and in all the wayes and forms of men; in the midſt of all their vanity and iniquity; and not be defiled with them: And this Spirit, when you are led by him, will enable you to live, either above them, or beſides them, or in the ſecret of his Tabernacle, which is within all there forms; and that with purity, peace and content: And this Spirit that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds and gives being to all forms and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; doth diſtinguiſh and perfectly judge, between the good and the evil of all <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>things;</hi> and doth eternally chuſe and gather unto himſelf, that which is holy in all, and caſts the chaff and duſt to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and him and it, into the Lake of fire.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:41851:101"/>
               <p>If therefore you have this Spirit, and will do that viſibly, which he doth eternally; then you muſt by him firſt gather all theſe things, and all the parts of the broken Church and Nation, under his wings; that he may do with our Chaos, as he did when he made the world; firſt ſuſtain, cheriſh, and brood upon this deſolate ſtate, and then form a new one: For if you cannot receive all into your hearts, and bowels of love, you will never renew, or reform any thing: For <hi>love is the firſt moving cauſe of all good: It is love only that hath in it that mercy, that life, that goodneſs, that can heal and reform the poor diſeaſed and decayed ſtate of man, and of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This excellent divine nature of God, <hi>Love,</hi> hath rejected with indignation, your harſh and ſevere ſpirit, of ſelf-ſaſety and ſelf-ſeeking, into confuſion and ſhame: And hath taken the work out of your hands into his own; after you have by violence and unskilfulneſs, ſpoyled, waſted and ruined, he will himſelf, ſave and reſtore: And in order to it, takes the whole frame of things in all its ſin, death, curſe and miſery, both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, parties, forms and ſtates, into the bowels of his moſt tender compaſſions; into himſelf and his own nature, life and being, who is
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41851:102"/>
                  <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us: In our fleſh, and ſo in and under our ſins and curſe; bearing of them for us, and from us: He hath love to thoſe <hi>perſons</hi> that you would deſtroy, finding his own image in them; for they are his own creatures and children; therefore he will ſave them; and firſt pardon, and then remove their iniquities: In thoſe <hi>offices,</hi> that you would deſtroy, he knows there is good in them, and in the honour and riches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them; and therefore will take away the abuſe and corruption of them: And in that <hi>ſervice</hi> that you ſo much vilifie, there is heavenly excellency, which muſt be preſerved, purified, enlightened; and all the death, darkneſs, and prophaneneſs ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it; <hi>The holy one of Iſrael</hi> will do this.</p>
               <p>Therefore to conclude this point of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you may and muſt know, That you were <hi>ſanctified,</hi> with a meaſure of gifts, for a ſervice for the execution of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Its work is finiſhed, the gifts corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and now as to publick work upon the Nation rejected; and under a judicial blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and confuſion, becauſe of an evil ſpirit that did and doth ſtill poſſeſs them: It is the righteous judgement of the Spirit of God upon them: who hath, though your gifts
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41851:102"/>and performances be many and ſolemn, <hi>caſt them as dung in your faces:</hi> If you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat with them, in humility and repentance, to attend the purifying of your own ſouls, and the purging away your own ſins, you will find mercy to your ſelves. But if you think by them, to exalt your ſelves again, into dominion and power in the Nation; you will but involve your ſelves in more miſery and wrath; and <hi>like a Bull in a net,</hi> entangle your ſouls in greater errours and outward troubles: The holy Spirit (I know and have felt) did bear you a long time, as a heavy burden; and at laſt eaſed himſelf of you, as a clog and cumber to him: And now I with joy feel that he is free to exerciſe his own power, to effect and perfect, what you have failed in: It will be your only ſafety, now to retire, into deep ſilence and humility, and leave the Church and Nation, to him that is Lord of both: who made both, and I can aſſure you, will perfectly reform both.</p>

               <p>BEſides the two things mentioned of the Kingdom of God, and of holineſs, there are ſome other things, that you have ſought in theſe late wars, which are ſtill in your minds: As <hi>common liberty,</hi> or the <hi>liberty of the people,</hi> and <hi>liberty of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> But it is moſt certainly true, and by experience now manifeſted, that theſe things are not in that ſpirit, in which you have acted and ſtill ſtand: Nor is this way of ſtrife and contention, the way to obtain them., but the contrary: For as war and enmity is againſt the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> which is a Kingdom of peace: And as they harden, pollute, and vitiate the mind of man, which is contrary to <hi>holineſs:</hi> So they do naturally exalt will and force, rage and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, and ſo muſt neceſſarily eat up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour all <hi>liberty;</hi> and turn all into the worſt kind of tyrannie; if the Father of mercies, and Spirits, doth not enlarge, mollifie, and ſweeten the nature of man, which wrath and war, doth imbitter and harden.</p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>common liberty</hi> is written, in the <hi>common nature</hi> of man, in ſome degree;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41851:103"/>though it be very weak: This <hi>liberty</hi> came forth in you, in notion, profeſſion, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, beyond what it doth in other people; and it hath been not only talked of, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by you; yet <hi>that ſpirit</hi> in which you roſe, and in which you ſeek it, hath not any <hi>true liberty</hi> in it; And if it hath not <hi>liberty</hi> in it, it can neither attain it for you from others, nor give it by you to others: it never could do either.</p>
               <p>Mind well what I write, elſe you will not underſtand it: For it is, I know, beſides the common reaſon and apprehenſions of men, and therefore ſeems to be, and is, ſtrange to the dark and private ſpirit of the world; but you and all men muſt know, that there is a divine reaſon in theſe things; which ought to be, and therefore ſhall be, the rule of mans Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Know then firſt, That we began our wars upon this principle of delivering <hi>our ſelves,</hi> from the yoak, of the Law and Government of the Church and Kingdom; being of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirit and way from them: And upon the ſame principle of <hi>ſelf-ſafety,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-freedom,</hi> was the war carried on; and the whole buſineſs, from ſtep to ſtep: This ſeemed to us very juſt and righteous, that we ſhould have liberty to ſerve God, according
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41851:104"/>to what light and underſtanding he gave us: And there is an undoubted right in it: Yet we ſee to what infinite confuſion, and ſtrange enmity and diviſion, this principle hath brought us: And therefore there is ſome notable evil, either in the principle, or in the liberty, or in both: I think both will be found faulty: I ſhall only charge the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple (that is) our ſeeking <hi>ſelf liberty,</hi> or liberty <hi>for our ſelves.</hi> Whatever good is in the thing, it doth and will miſcarry, ſo long as it is upon this bottom <hi>ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such is the large and good nature of the <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> that he will blaſt and wither every private and particular ſpirit. It is contrary to him, hath no root in him, and therefore though he do ſometimes feed it awhile, and make uſe of it, yet he will at laſt reject it; and never ſuffer it to ſtand up with him in his Kingdom: He may and doth admit it to work, and act, in ſome low, remote, and dark ſtate: But if he be true to his <hi>own Good nature,</hi> or to the <hi>nature of his Son,</hi> the Saviour of the world; he muſt not admit it to raign with him, nor will he: Yea though it cloath it ſelf with <hi>ſalvation,</hi> either of our own, of others ſouls; which is a thing moſt agreeable to the mercy of God; yet will he never <hi>ſave</hi> any in that ſpirit: But
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41851:104"/>reſiſt and oppoſe that ſalvation, and all the graces and gifts whereby men ſeek it, till he kill that root of ſelf: For he hath given it as a Law to Chriſt, and ſo by Chriſt to men; <hi>he that will ſave his life ſhall loſt it,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> only <hi>that will loſe his life ſhall ſave it:</hi> It was the great leſſon he taught <hi>his Son,</hi> and the firſt that Chriſt teaches his Diſciples: <hi>Let him deny himſelf:</hi> If Chriſt and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, muſt deny ſo excellent and holy life, and ſelf, that they may aſcend unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all: If that holy and bleſſed ſtate muſt be abjured and renounced, and ſo come to the curſe: What can you think of <hi>ſelf-ſeeking,</hi> of an <hi>out ward liberty</hi> and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from outward ſufferings? it is no wonder to ſee tins brought to ſhame and confuſion.</p>
               <p>God hath purſued this root of ſelf-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even in ſpiritual things, by many ſore and ſevere tryals in my ſpirit: By which I came to underſtand what an irreconcileable and deſperate enemy it is to God, and what deadly poyſon there is in the nature of it; and how dangerouſly it will corrupt the beſt things in men: Where ever it is admitted, it will and doth kill the life of Grace, if God kill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ot it: And though at firſt it ſeem zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy, yet it will break out into groſs
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41851:105"/>ſelf-ſeeking: For he that prayes, preaches, believes, ſtudies, and receives the promiſes of eternal life to <hi>himſelf,</hi> or to a party, which is but a large <hi>ſelf;</hi> will at laſt in all things, mind himſelf; and ſo will be cruel, covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ambitious, and any thing that <hi>ſelf</hi> ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts to him: And this I find to be the root of all that narrowneſs that was in this Party, and of that groſs <hi>ſelf-ſeeking,</hi> that all men take notice of: There is at the bottom of the whole buſineſs, and at the root of all their Religion, a ſpirit to ſeek their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, liberty, exaltation and honour: And being fixed and bound to this principle, they could never enlarge themſelves to the good of the whole; nor were they ever capable of any larger principles, nor can they be, till this ſtate be ſlain in them: And though they ſhift from one thing to another, they will find no reſt, till they ſubject this ſtate to loſs, and thereby come to partake of the largeneſs of the love of God, and Chriſt: Who teaches us to ſeek, <hi>not our own, but the things of others;</hi> not <hi>our own</hi> liberty or ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but the liberty and ſalvation <hi>of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Lord of all, that he might diſcover, judge and deſtroy this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſo contrary to his own <hi>love</hi> and <hi>life,</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:41851:105"/>hath ſo ordered it: That he that will <hi>not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf,</hi> his life, liberty and ſalvation, for the good of others, in conformity unto Chriſt, and in obedience to his Goſpel; They will be found to be perſecutors, cruel deſtroyers of others lives and liberties; and ſo be brought to ſhame and deſtruction: <hi>They that will not ſuffer for, and from others; others muſt ſuffer from them: And they that cannot give their life, will take away others life:</hi> It is and will be reſolved into this; that men muſt either live in the merciful and ſaving ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or in the cruel ſpirit of the <hi>Devil:</hi> And no ſhew or form of godlineſs, nor pretence of right or religion, can evade this judgement: For <hi>ſtrong is the Lord</hi> that thus judges.</p>
               <p>It is therefore evident, and God will make it good, that there is not common ſalvation, nor good will to man, in any private ſpirit of any Party, but in the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>the Saviour of the world:</hi> And that this true publick ſpirit, where ever it is, it ſhews it ſelf by this, it will ſuffer for and from others, and not make others ſuffer from it; it will and doth give life and liberty, and not take it away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt ſtep into freedom, is out of our ſelves: and the beginning; of all ingenuity, is
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41851:106"/>to be able, to examine, try, and judge our ſelves:</hi> If by experience, and by what is here written you attain, the leaſt ſpark of true freedom; and can but reflect upon your ſelves, and remember the firſt riſe of your work; that it was to deliver <hi>your ſelves;</hi> and that in the whole progreſs of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was terminated and bounded in <hi>ſelf,</hi> either in a finer or a groſſer way; and could do nothing but prefer or exalt <hi>your ſelves</hi> and Party, or them that would confirm and ſtrengthen <hi>your ſelves,</hi> by ſerving of you: And that all the while you were buſie in this work, you could not but oppreſs others; not only your enemies, but the whole Nation: And that none of you could ever produce any publick eaſe, liberty, or advantage to the people; but on the contrary, taxes and burdens: If you have but ſo much ingenuity, as to judge your ſelves, ſtate and ſpirit, and juſtifie God and Chriſt, we ſhall ſoon agree: If you do ſo, and come forth of that hole, that pit, of a narrow private Religion, that <hi>ſelf</hi> or <hi>party,</hi> holineſs and ſalvation; which is really now a pit and ſnare, whatever exaltation it hath had: If you can now but look out of it, and view things in the light of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal goodneſs of God, your reaſon will tell you.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:41851:106"/>
               <p>That for you that are but a ſmall part of the Nation; it may be a <hi>tenth;</hi> either for number or quality; a <hi>tenth,</hi> that is, a more active, vigilant, more ſpirited part of the whole: For you, in times of trouble, to get the ſword into your hands, and to overthrow the Government and Governors of the whole; which the whole chuſe and reſt ſatisfied in, and to ſeclude the <hi>nine</hi> parts of the repreſentative of the whole, and admit: of none to rule but your own <hi>tithe:</hi> To ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the civil Government, and exalt the ſword: To depoſe <hi>one,</hi> natural, choſen, beloved; and <hi>one</hi> in judgement and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>nine</hi> parts: And to ſet up <hi>many,</hi> in many various wayes and opinions, all ſtrange to the whole Nation, if not hated: And to impoſe your ſelves, your ſenſe and reaſon, your taxes and payments, with your religions and opinions, by force of arms upon the people; under penalty of being malignants, the wicked, and ſo not worthy to enjoy any priviledge: If you have as much power in your reaſon now, as you had once in your ſwords, to make this, <hi>common freedom,</hi> I muſt be your ſlave, and the whole Nation with me.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe you intended freedom; yet good meanings or intentions muſt not juſtifie ill
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41851:107"/>actions: Good intentions will not avail in a mans own ſoul; much leſs ſave a Nation: They are falſe intentions, if the thing it ſelf intended, be not in the intention: If the thing it ſelf be there, it will wiſely direct, and ſtrongly work, to bring forth it ſelf, and will not miſcarry: But that which is a falſe and deceitful intention, may ſeem to aim at the end, but as a <hi>broken bow,</hi> will carry the arrow to another mark, to a private advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and not publick freedom: But ſuppoſe that indeed you were publick perſons, and had the good of the whole Nation in you, and knew it before you offered to ſtir; which to this day, you cannot own: Yet would you think to beat this freedom into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by force? Freedom is not freedom, if we be compelled to it: You never learned this, either of the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Goſpel:</hi> God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would, nor did offer to rule over any, but by their conſent: The moſt glorious things, if the ſubject be not diſpoſed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and ſo opened to receive them; are and will be a torment to minds averſe from them: By how much more, any way ſeems to have more light and ſtrength then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if it enforce it ſelf upon that which is weaker and darker, it is more injurious, then for the darker to impoſe it ſelf upon the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41851:107"/>ſtronger: Becauſe, where there is light and ſtrength, they are more able to bear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and burdens of the weak, then the weak is able to bear the ſtrong: They that have light and ſtrength, will ſhift well under the darker power, and either evade the force, or live and thrive under it: But if a weak dark people, come to be ruled by the force of a more knowing, they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſupport them, but muſt ſink under it: And either they muſt diſſemble and be hypocrites, or be ſots and beaten like beaſts, becauſe they are not better, or be other-wayes abuſed and enſlaved.</p>
               <p>People may ſet up notions of things to pleaſe their fancies, or to colour and paint a buſineſs: But for the <hi>Common-people,</hi> either they are well pleaſed with their Government and Governours, and ſo quietly reſt under them; and then they are as free, as they deſire to be; and ſo they are, having liberty to buy and ſell, to purchaſe and enjoy their eſtates: Or if they are ſenſible that any thing oppreſſes them, as the Government of <hi>England</hi> is by Parliaments, they have power to free themſelves, by chuſing ſuch Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives as will take care of them and their liberties: Liberty is for men, not beaſts; beaſts muſt be yoaked: If liberty be only
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41851:108"/>for men, then it muſt be a rational liberty, a freedom for reaſon, and a freedom accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reaſon: And if according to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then according to Law and by conſent: And therefore the way to procure ſuch a liberty, is not by war, which exalts force, and depoſes reaſon: It exalts diviſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes agreement: And there is no liberty, but where there is a free exerciſe of reaſon, in order to conſent: And that <hi>to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> would never be admitted by the late power: <hi>For that which ſtands by force, dares not ſubmit to reaſon:</hi> But know certainly, that as you do ſee, <hi>war</hi> provokes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperates mens minds into rage and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and pollutes the ſtreams of Juſtice, filling mens hearts with cruelty, partiality, hardneſs and ſelf-love: So the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> in the ſhining forth of general love and light, into all perſons and things; will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the darkneſs, and conſequently the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and oppreſſion: For <hi>the dark places of the earth, are full of the habitations of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Pſal.</hi> 74.20. This ſpirit hath ſufficiency of light and love, to expell <hi>the evil one,</hi> out of the whole body, out of Governors and people joyntly: And will not ſet up one againſt another: the people againſt the Prince, or the Prince againſt the people:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41851:108"/>Such unskilful Surgeons, wound and break, but heal not: The wiſdom of God, which formed all out of himſelf, and ſuſtains them all in himſelf, hath life, light, and liberty, for the whole in himſelf, and will give it forth to all parts and parties.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>LIberty of Conſcience</hi> hath been a great plea amongſt us in theſe times; a very buſie body in our troubles: Whence he comes, and of what raſe he is, I believe no body knows: If he can avoid examination, I perceive he will; for he is very nice and tender, and will ſuffer no body to come near him: I did think to have let him paſs, becauſe as ſoon as he is touched, he will clamour: Therefore for my credit, I thought to avoid him: But I conſider again, that it is not juſt, out of fear to fly any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in a mans diſcourſe, if it lie in his way: Therefore if I will be true to my own mind, I cannot wholly wave him: I muſt a little try him; or at leaſt examine how he hath behaved himſelf in theſe times.</p>
               <p>For my own ſelf I profeſs, an univerſal Liberty for all forms and profeſſions, from
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41851:109"/>the Papiſt to the Quaker, or Fifth-monarchy men: Becauſe I know there is ſome good in all, and therefore have a love to all, not only of pitty, to the worſt and weakeſt; but of complacency: For I know, that although they are now drawn out into an oppoſition one againſt another, yet truth, that is but one in it ſelf, is divided amongſt them; and therefore there is a ſecret union betwixt them: I know the wideſt meet, not only their perſons in one life; but their opinions in one reaſon alſo: And therefore it is no hard matter, I think, if they were but tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to put them all in one circle; where the extream parts would meet: the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end be the ſame: For certainly the Quaker, is a kind of a Catholick, and the Fifth-monarchy man is a kind of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon, why I would that all might have all <hi>liberty of Conſcience,</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know there is that reaſon, and light in truth and power among us, which is able both to ſubdue and unite all mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For conſcience is but <hi>one,</hi> and truth, the rule of conſcience is <hi>one</hi> alſo. It is true, there is great confuſion among us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abundance of error; which ſhews there is much diſtemper, blindneſs, and ſickneſs of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41851:109"/>mind: Outward puniſhments enrage and obdurate; and therefore are improper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for diſeaſed minds: They cannot heal the underſtanding; but they may, and do harden the heart, againſt them that inflict them: and ſo confirm and ſtrengthen the errour and diſtemper, and fill the mind with more enmity, and conſequently with more blindneſs: How much is poor man to be pittied, whoſe zeal for God and the worſhip of God, is ſo miſerably diſtracted and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; as to be made uſe of, only to deſtroy one another: And that <hi>Religion,</hi> which is the Law of love, peace, and ſalvation, ſhould become the great engine of death, wrath, and deſtruction; and no remedy againſt it.</p>
               <p>Sure it will be conſidered, That truth is one in Chriſt: That Jeſus is the head of man; and that mans nature, reaſon and underſtanding, is his own body and ſpouſe: That Religion unites and binds this head and body, in a Covenant of marriage: That love, life and truth, are only in this union: And that therefore <hi>truth, life,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> are together, and they that leave one, they leave all: If ſo, then they that love not, err from the truth, and they that by their opinions, are taught to hate and kill, live neither in love
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41851:110"/>nor truth, but in death and darkneſs: Error and enmity do deſtroy, and they that do deſtroy, are moſt in deſtruction; becauſe to them may be applyed that title given to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. <hi>he that had power of death;</hi> for they that in malice inflict it, have power of it.</p>
               <p>All truth is moſt beautiful and lovely, even unto the reaſon of man; and all errour is a lye, and monſtrous, even to the mind of man: both in it ſelf, and in the foul and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh effects of it: When the light ſhall ſhine forth to manifeſt this, men will of themſelves fly from errour, avoid hatred, and love the truth.</p>
               <p>Satisfie your ſelves therefore, you that ſeem to be zealous for truth, of any ſide or party; and know, That as mens ſouls and conſciences are the body and Spouſe of Chriſt; ſo they are his care and charge: He hath with him a Law wherewith to govern this body; and power over all conſcience, and ſevere puniſhment, for them that are proud and rebellious: He hath a <hi>ſpiritual Court,</hi> and a <hi>ſpiritual Law,</hi> with <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> to execute <hi>Spiritual judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> And conſcience is moſt ſenſible of his ſtrokes, and moſt eaſily ſubjected to him; and therefore will be ruled by him:
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41851:110"/>To him it doth belong to do it, and to him alone, and he will do it.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe grounds, I do in my ſpirit give liberty to all perſwaſions, having a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and reaſon that comprehends them all in one: And knowing that one mercy and goodneſs, upholds, ſaves and forgives all; and that one truth, and one Goſpel, is under all, and in all: And being ſenſible, of that one enemy, that doth abuſe all; by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them, in zeal for ſome part of truth, againſt their brethren; knowing likewiſe <hi>that light,</hi> that will ſcattter this darkneſs, and unite all in one, in one heart, and in one way: Theſe things being true, there is reaſon all ſhould have liberty, to challenge and plead their right, in order to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Which muſt as certainly have its time, as confuſion hath had his time.</p>
               <p>There is order, in and under this confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and will ariſe out of it; yea this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, is to this end, that a more large and excellent love and light might come forth, to reduce all this into order and harmony: And when it doth manifeſt it ſelf, it will not only joyn ſome parts, that are neareſt one to another; but will unite all: <hi>I abſolutely think it impoſſible, to make any true union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt any two or three parties or ſects in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41851:111"/>Nation, leaving out the reſt; as it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to build an houſe, of ſome parts of the frame, of ſome poſts and pillars, excluding and denying other parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a Church of <hi>England,</hi> or in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (it is I think all one): If ever there was one, there is ſtill one (if there be among us the profeſſion and Faith of Jeſus) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Church is built upon a rock, and the Gates of hell cannot prevail againſt it:</hi> If hell ſhould take it captive, and either carry the Church into hell, or hell come forth and poſſeſs the Church, with all its filthyneſs, wickedneſs, darkneſs, and confuſion: Yet it would be ſtill <hi>the body of Chriſt,</hi> and therefore it ſtill is, not only ſafe in all this; but beloved and honoured by him: Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt may and doth <hi>ſit in the Temple of God,</hi> and defile this <hi>temple of God,</hi> but it is ſtill <hi>the temple of God:</hi> And the Gentiles may enter <hi>into the holy City,</hi> and <hi>trample it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,</hi> but it is ſtill, and ever ſhall be, the <hi>holy City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we deny there is or was a Church, I am ſure no man among us hath power to plant a Church: For no Church of God, was ever <hi>planted in the earth,</hi> but by power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>from heaven,</hi> and by a <hi>pattern from the Mount.</hi> Men cannot ſo much as repair a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41851:111"/>decayed Church, without an heavenly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing: Therefore if there was no Church there is none: For our new Churches chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge not <hi>from heaven,</hi> but from the letter.</p>
               <p>If there be a Church of <hi>England;</hi> then all Engliſh men that profeſs faith in Jeſus are members of it; Till this Church caſt them out; till they be judicially proceeded againſt; by the Church her ſelf: Be they never ſo corrupt, they are corrupt members, of her corrupt body; till ſhe recover her power to caſt them out: And ſhe and all her parts muſt own them, and bear them, and all their filth and guilt, till they be cut off.</p>
               <p>It is not in the power of any parts except they have the power of the whole, to caſt out any: It is much leſs in the power of any parts, to caſt out the whole Church, or to unchurch the Church: Nor is it in the power of any to diſmember himſelf: they may like froward children run away when they are ill uſed, but that doth not diſſolve the relation betwixt parents and children; nor acquit either from their duty: All the ſeparations, and abjurations; of all the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants, Anabaptiſts, and Quakers, doth not make them no members of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Neither are they thereby no children of the true Fathers of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:41851:112"/>Nor muſt we therefore ceaſe loving of them inſtructing of them, becauſe they have like the <hi>prodigal got a portion, and gone from their Fathers houſe:</hi> If the relation holds, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that relation, will be required; of Fathers, authority, wiſdom, juſtice, and love; and of children, obedience, and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; And no ill affection or deſpoſition, can diſſolve a relation; An ignorant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> weak, decayed old man, is a Father; and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, bold, rebellious Son, is a Son.</p>
               <p>The way to bring wandring <hi>ſheep</hi> to the fold, is to <hi>ſeek them out.</hi> And the way to reduce <hi>prodigals,</hi> is to ſuffer them to want: There are both theſe; <hi>ſimplicity</hi> to be <hi>ſought out:</hi> and conceited <hi>prodigality,</hi> and this will <hi>ſtarve,</hi> and come to great <hi>want:</hi> And then, if there be <hi>bread in our Fathers houſe,</hi> they will be compelled to ſeek it: I know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, they will be in great neceſſity, of ſpiritual food, that ſpend ſo prodigally, in <hi>harlots houſes,</hi> in boaſting, glorying, and quarrelling: and then where bread is, they muſt bow for it, and will: and then the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> and <hi>Shepheard</hi> that can feed them, will be honoured by them.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>England</hi> be ſtill a Church, or there be a Church in <hi>England,</hi> of old and late, and all men profeſſing faith
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41851:112"/>in Chriſt, are members; and neither the worſt nor beſt, are diſmembred, but all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue one body, though broken and under confuſion: Then as every particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is apart; ſo parties united by any bond of ſpirit, perſwaſion or opinion, muſt needs be a great part, an integral part: And if ſo, there can be no peace, nor building, but of all theſe parties: And it is eaſier, for a <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> to conſtitute a houſe of all, then for another to make a ſhed, or hovel of ſome parts: But there will never be any harmony nor health in the body, if every <hi>joint ſupply</hi> not its place: It is <hi>love</hi> only can unite and heal, and only an <hi>intire love,</hi> or a <hi>love of the whole, to the whole:</hi> If any part be rejected there is want of love, or love is not in that agreement, that leaves out any part; and if love be not there; the agreement will not hold: <hi>Love</hi> the more, the diviſions, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and greater the diſtance; the more able it is to unite, and the more pleaſed to do it; becauſe it is infinite. And the greater the variety is, the more <hi>wiſdom</hi> delights to ſhew its skill in ordering and compoſing of them into harmony; and the more excellent will the muſick be, when compoſed.</p>
               <p>It is not imaginable, that any one Party, can comprehend the whole: nor can any
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41851:113"/>one Party comprehend any other Party: And therefore every perſon and Party, will in their divided ſtate, think and conclude an union impoſſible: But as it is impoſſible for any party, or few parties to agree or to think how to agree; ſo it is impoſſible but the whole muſt agree; becauſe ſhe comprehends all the parts; and they all do conſiſt in her, and ſhe conſiſts only by and in all. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the reaſon of any, or many parts, be they eminent parts, cannot unite the whole; while they ſtand as parts, divided from any of the whole; So the reaſon of the whole, cannot but comprehend and gather into it all the parts, and conſequently muſt unite all: For all do already meet in that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall reaſon, wherein and whereby both all the parts, and the whole ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon of the liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that is in my mind: I would that all may have liberty to come forth, to come together, and to agree: and to agree firſt in this point of liberty: For it is impoſſible that ever we ſhould agree or conſent by force: No man will agree to be beaten: If we give not liberty to men to profeſs, enquire, and bring forth their minds, we deny them liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to conſent: For there cannot be a free conſent, till there be all freedom to profeſs
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41851:113"/>and to debate; and of all means, both of profeſſing, and trying all things: What is reſtrained and impriſoned by jealouſie and enmity, is thereby ſhut up in diviſion, and denyed both the firſt ſtep to, and the right means of agreement: And is thereby enforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dwell in it ſelf, and to maintain its own private divided ſtate; being thruſt out from all fellowſhip with the whole: The admitting all to come abroad, into open light and profeſſion, with liberty to try, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of peace and agreement.</p>
               <p>But as I would give this liberty of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: ſo I expect, and may juſtly challenge, a liberty to deal with this conſcience, in the way of conſcience: For therefore would I that their conſciences may come forth, that they may be convinced and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: Sure then you will not deny me liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reprove, and rebuke: and if I can, to wound and afflict your conſciences, if they be guilty; If they be not guilty, I cannot hurt them; if they be, it muſt be known, felt, and diſcovered, elſe they cannot be healed: It is a freedom that God hath given me, to reprove and reform;I ſhall uſe it, and I hope ſo uſe it, as not to be denyed the exerciſe of it: At this time, I would examine, this plea of liberty of conſcience, as it hath
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41851:114"/>been urged all along in our late troubles.</p>
               <p>I do very much ſuſpect this title and claim of conſcience to liberty, or liberty for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as it hath been, and ſtill is promoted by many; that there is ſome notable evil in it, more then hath been yet diſcovered: For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Where the whole is unſound, the parts muſt needs be ſo alſo: And therefore if there hath been deceit and hypocriſie, in the whole ſtate and ſpirit of this work, this of liberty of conſcience being a great part of the buſineſs, muſt neceſſarily partake of the corruption of the whole.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I cannot derive it from any antient and honourable root: The Jews while they were in their own land, they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not liberty, for they were under a Law of neceſſity and duty; I do not remember that ever they deſired it, when they were in captivity: In <hi>Aegypt</hi> they would not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>Lo, ſhall we ſacrifice the abomination of the Aegyptians before their eyes, and will they not ſtone us?</hi> Gen. 8.26. And in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> they ſaid, <hi>How ſhall we ſing the Lords ſong in a ſtrange land?</hi> Pſal. 137.4. I am ſure if you had been as ſenſible of your ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al al captivity, as they were of their outward, you would not have made ſuch haſte to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41851:114"/>and ſet up ſo many <hi>notes</hi> or <hi>ſongs:</hi> When you feel the confuſion that is in your ſpirits, you will find you are ſtill in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>hang up your harps, and mourn</hi> inſtead of <hi>ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> I am moſt certain of this, there hath been a whoriſh impudency in the great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty taken, to pray, profeſs, build Churches, Miniſtries and Worſhip: And for this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual whoredom is liberty pleaded, as well as for conſcience.</p>
               <p>Neither did the Apoſtles, or the Primitive Chriſtians, ſeek for liberty of conſcience, from the Princes of the world: But having commiſſion from Chriſt the ſupream Lord, to preach the Goſpel, they executed it boldly and freely: They were called both to preach and ſuffer, and therefore did not ſeek liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the croſs: A true ſpiritual Miniſtry derives it ſelf immediately from the perſon of Chriſt, who is exalted <hi>far above all princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and powers:</hi> And being far above them, they need not, cannot rightly ſeek for a licence from them, to obey the commands of a ſuperiour Lord. If the powers of the world be only <hi>worldly,</hi> and the life and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Saints heavenly:</hi> the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> is above the <hi>earthly;</hi> and may juſtly bleſs, preſerve and inſtruct the <hi>earthly:</hi> and the <hi>earthly</hi> is to ſubmit to the ſpiritual and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41851:115"/>
                  <hi>heavenly:</hi> If the powers of the world are, as they were then, <hi>in the wicked one,</hi> then it was not only in vain, but a wicked thing, for the ſervants of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſeek to his enemy <hi>the devil,</hi> and his enemies, <hi>wicked men,</hi> for an outward liberty: They would rather ſuffer from them, then ſo acknowledge them: Therefore liberty of conſcience, will be found a new and upſtart thing, born in this age, amongſt many other weak things, and that it is not of the old raſe of the right, generous, and <hi>heavenly Saints:</hi> It may be pittied and indulged, but cannot challenge much.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This liberty of conſcience <hi>ſeeks earthly things,</hi> and outward freedom; Which is not only for conſcience, or but for an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and earthly conſcience; and with that for worldly eaſe, honour, and advantage: For conſcience, <hi>if the Son make him free,</hi> and ſo <hi>he be free indeed;</hi> it can and doth live with God, and with men, in heaven and in earth, and under the earth; in bonds, chains, and death: and is ſtill free with God and Chriſt, and cannot be confined: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome outward thing that is pleaded for, as well as, or more then, liberty of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is a common obſervation, that men while they have been under their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41851:115"/>and in a low condition, then they cry up liberty of Conſcience; but when the ſame perſons have attained power, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not themſelves then with liberty, but ſet up their conſciences; to be a Law to others: It hath been practiſed by all ſorts of people, as they have gotten power into their hands, in ſome degree or other: They have all puniſhed ſome, for Conſcience: Let this be well examined, and if we can, let us find out the reaſon of it; it will enlighten mens minds, and clear the truth: Conſider then,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether conſcience receiving its Law and rule from God, the ſupream Lord, ought not to exalt that Law (as it hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity) and hold it forth as a Law to all men: I believe it is ſo; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience taught and inſtituted of God, is truly royal and Princely in his nature, and both muſt and will rule: Which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why neither the Jews nor Chriſtians would ſeek to their enemies, or to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then States for liberty, but knowing and loving the majeſty of their Lord, they would either raign with him, or ſuffer with him, and from him.</p>
               <p>If this be the royal nature of truth, then it follows, 1. That whatever men profeſs,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41851:116"/>when they are down and low, yet we muſt expect, that when they get up, they will exalt, that which they hold to be truth, as high as they can , and exalt themſelves with it. And 2. If they pretend otherwiſe, they do either weakly or deceitfully hide and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their minds; or elſe baſely ſtoop below the majeſtie of truth, for preſent eaſe and advantage. And 3. If we our ſelves, by the Law of our own life and religion, do exalt our religion as a Law; we muſt not wonder if others do ſo alſo; but have reaſon to be content with it, and ſubmit to it. And 4. Knowing that the Law and Religion of our Lord Jeſus, muſt and will rule; if we have it with us, and in us, it will be ſufficient, 1. To uphold us in a low ſtate. 2. To aſſure us, that whatever other perſons or ſpirits God ſets up, they muſt come down with ſhame. 3. That when that Law comes to riſe, we ſhall riſe and raign with it. And 4. In the mean time ſuffering with it, will prepare us to raign with it, and him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If this be true, that conſcience rightly taught and enlightened, is and will be a Law to all men; then what a poor or falſe conſcience is that, which craves liberty of men? If it be only weak, it is to be pittied, if it be an evil thing, it is to be
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41851:116"/>judged: Be it one or other, we ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it is to be ſuſpected: For if it be carnal and naught, when it is low, it will be certainly worſe when it gets power: If it be baſe, ſubtile, and ſerpentine, when it is poor; it will be cruel and tyrannical when it riſes. Therefore though there be a natural right to liberty of Conſcience, yet it is juſt reaſon it ſhould be examined: For fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, They that profeſs much for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience, could never give it to others; neither to their enemies, that firſt denyed it to them, nor to them that needed it from them: I do think they that contend for it, will never grant it: That large and generous ſpirit, that ſhall he able to give it, will neither need it, nor ſtoop ſo low as to ask it: And that narrow, low, fleſhly mind, that knows not how to bear the darkneſs and ſhortneſs of them that are above him; I doubt would leſs bear the darkneſs and ſhortneſs of them that are under him.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, This liberty of Conſcience, hath brought forth to the Church, a very ſtrange brood of abſurd opinions, looſe practiſes, proud and rebellious ſpirits, to the ſcorn of Religion, contempt of all kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, breaking of all relations, of all bonds,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41851:117"/>natural, civil and religious: Now that which is a cauſe or occaſion of ſo much ill, hath certainly an evil thing in it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is no clear nor ſtrong ground to engage upon.</p>
               <p>There is no queſtion, but men in tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their own fleſh and bodies, do when they are in danger of ſuffering, cry up liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience, as a great thing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry the contrary beyond meaſure: Paſſion, paſſion for ſelf, for ſelf unmortified, to avoid the Croſs, is not a proper judge of Laws, Liberties, Religions and Kingdoms: It doth likewiſe appear, from what hath been ſaid, that this liberty contended for, is not according to the antient Chriſtian and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical ſpirit: But a carnal, impure and mixed thing: Yet on the other ſide, I do acknowledge, there is a humane and natural right in it, which although it be weak and low, ought to be conſidered and pittied: It being a thing of natural and rational equity, if it be fairly and rationally demanded, it may I ſuppoſe be had: His Majeſty hath in goodneſs and prudence graciouſly promiſed and declared it: It is in it ſelf a reaſonable thing, and therefore if reaſonably claimed, the reaſon of man cannot juſtly deny it: And much leſs <hi>reaſon of State,</hi> which is the reaſon
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41851:117"/>of the Nation: Beſides the natural reaſon of it, the preſent ſtate of the Nation gives it a great advantage, and makes it even to <hi>reaſon of State,</hi> (which is the preſervation of civil peace) neceſſary: And therefore nothing ſo likely to endanger it, as mens ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational, heady and violent oppoſing the Government of the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>And therefore I affirm , that for you to ſtand out, in open enmity to the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in attempting war and hoſtility, or in preaching and praying againſt it, or curſing and reviling of it, as wicked or Antichriſtian (which tends to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, either by war or otherwiſe:) To continue in this, is not the way to procure liberty of Conſcience, but to overthrow and deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>This liberty of Conſcience, muſt be had, either by an utter ruine of all that is againſt it, and ſo of the preſent Government: Or elſe by a friendly agreement, with theſe or any other Governours: If you reſolve upon the firſt, to deſtroy all that are not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your conſcience, that your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may have liberty: Then you would deſtroy all mens conſciences but your own, and all men for their conſciences; which is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41851:118"/>the moſt contrary to liberty of Conſcience that can be: Moſt contrary, becauſe you will endure none but your ſelves; and that you would raiſe a war, that you might eſtabliſh a Law of cruelty, which is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times worſe, then to perſecute by an eſtabliſhed Law and Authority: That power that you would have, muſt be thorow the lives, of thouſands of your enemies; and after that, thouſands of your friends; for they that ſtrive for a power, never did nor never will agree in the ſharing or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of it: But when through blood and deſtruction of friends and foes, you have gotten it : If you ſhould prevail, and you in your own perſons eſcape, yet that power gotten by war, in that ſpirit, you and we in reaſon muſt expect, that it will be moſt cruel, becauſe raiſed and begotten by cruelty. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is ſo horrid and irrational, that the bare propoſing of it, will make reaſonable men abhor ſuch a thought: For nothing but irrational and blind zeal, with diſcontent and paſſion, can ſo much blind the nature of man, as to lead him into ſuch unnatural things.</p>
               <p>If your ſpirits, do indeed drive to this, to the removing and deſtroying the preſent ſtate of things, as an accurſed thing; then
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41851:118"/>the ingenuous, and ſeek not liberty from them, nor complain of them for not giving it: For every ſuch acknowledgement of them, doth confirm them, and ſo contradict your prayers and endeavours to deſtroy them: Sometimes ſecretly and cunningly to curſe them, and another time openly and for advantage to acknowledge them, is falſhood and deceit: And will attain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſhame and confuſion: For there is little but ſhame and confuſion in it: It is a vile thing, in private and ſecret to pray, or warily to preach againſt a State, and openly to comply with it: in ſo doing our lives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict our prayers, or our prayers our lives.</p>
               <p>But if this be the drift of your ſpirits, though never ſo warily carried; do you think, it is not felt and underſtood by them that you ſo oppoſe? you cannot conceal it from them: It is wiſe counſel <hi>Solomon</hi> gives, <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in thy thought,</hi> or conſcience, <hi>for a bird of the air ſhall carry the voice, and that which hath wings ſhall tell the matter:</hi> It muſt be underſtood ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for it cannot be meant literally: Angels are <hi>intelligences</hi> and intelligencers, they are <hi>principalities and powers,</hi> and attend both the <hi>Throne</hi> and <hi>Altar;</hi> they are preſent in
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41851:119"/>dominion at <hi>Court,</hi> and in your Cloſets at your <hi>devotions:</hi> They are <hi>the birds,</hi> and <hi>that which hath wings,</hi> that <hi>tell the matter:</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick authority, hath publick ears and eyes, and reach all corners: Spiritual intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as well as outward informers.</p>
               <p>If they know and feel, that you intend their deſtruction; muſt they not abhor that ſpirit, that under pretence of liberty of Conſcience, really endeavours liberty of deſtroying, and of overthrowing Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to exalt themſelves.</p>
               <p>And if they underſtand any thing, they muſt think: Theſe men ſeek our deſtruction, and as they pray for it, and preach it, ſo they will, if they can or dare, attempt it, as they have done: And therefore they having ſuch a ſenſe of you, you cannot in reaſon expect but that they ſhould labour to ſuppreſs you: If they find rebellion, war, and wrath in the principles of it, though in religious duties and conſcience; will they not ſuppreſs both the rebellion, and conſcience, and the duties or worſhip in which it is? And ſhall they not be juſtified in ſo doing? I am ſure your Law and Practiſe will juſtifie them: For the ſame thing hath been done often; and would be again, if you had power, while you are in this ſpirit.</p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:41851:119"/>
               <p>When you ſhall recover either your own nature and reaſon, or the nature of the Lamb, out of this Spiritual drunkenneſs and cruel zeal; you will find,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Antichriſt, the great enemy of Chriſt, is alſo an enemy to man, to his life, peace, civil order, Law, and to all humane Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this enemy is a ſpirit, <hi>the Angel of the bottomleſs pit:</hi> And therefore his chief ſeat and place is in ſpiritual things, in conſcience, and in the ſpirits of men, and in thoſe things wherein ſpiritual men, or the ſpirits of men, are exerciſed; in gifts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and holy duties; and his laſt and greateſt ſtrength is not in corrupt forms, but in thoſe that are moſt ſpiritual, moſt lively, zealous and gifted: Others are but the <hi>fleſh,</hi> theſe the <hi>horns of the beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, And therefore conſcience, and the ſpirits of men, even in Religion, and in lively or ſpiritual Religion, is grievouſly polluted by him: This <hi>Templo of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed</hi> by him: You muſt come to know it and feel it, as I have done.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The nature of this beaſt is to deſtroy; whence he hath his name <hi>Apollyon,</hi> a deſtroyer: His higheſt place is conſcience gifted, mens ſpirits enlightened; and his
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41851:120"/>higheſt work is to kill and deſtroy; and in order to that, to curſe and blaſpheme with thoſe ſpiritual gifts.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This ſpiritual beaſt, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer, cannot but be ſeen and felt by the common reaſon of men; although they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge him, yet they muſt have a ſenſe of him, as an enemy to that life , and peace, in which they live; and to that Authority and Government which is committed to them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, As they cannot but diſcern, and feel <hi>the horns</hi> of <hi>this beaſt,</hi> that puſhes them and wounds them; ſo they cannot but arm themſelves, with ſuch weapons as they have againſt him: If it be a State, it will defend it ſelf by Laws, puniſhments, policies and power.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, This ſelf-defence, though it be earthly cannot be denyed them; yea they will be juſtified in it, ſo far as it is rational, humane and neceſſary, and for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace and common ſafety: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any are cruel and revengeful, that is devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh alſo; and then it is <hi>the beaſt,</hi> againſt <hi>the beaſt:</hi> But an humane care to maintain Law, Authority and Peace (though it be no more) yet it is good againſt a deſtroying ſpirit, that would bring in war and confuſion, under the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41851:120"/>higheſt notion of Religion and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The ordinary and common Ordinances of man; are to be juſtified in acting againſt a Religion &amp; Zeal, that ſeeks the ſubverting of them: The firſt is uſeful, neceſſary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; the other is hurtful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The Law and Authority of a Nation, defending it ſelf from this ſpirit, by its own weapons, being outward, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall upon the perſons, lives and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of them that are ngaged in this ſpirit.</p>
               <p>I am grieved in my ſoul for both, both wound my heart; both the agents and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients: In love to mankind, I am afflicted for them, and feel the unhappineſs of them, that are under a Law and neceſſity of ſo acting; and them that are under a Law and neceſſity of ſo ſuffering: If either my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains, or my knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, yea or my life if ſelf, may do any thing to cure this evil, and quench this flame, I ſhould gladly expend them all.</p>
               <p>And for you my friends, to whom in love and mercy this is directed, I know it will not only ſeem ſtrange to you, but be very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to bear; to find ſo great a ſpiritual enemy, in the midſt of your ſpiritual gifts
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41851:121"/>and enjoyments: I know you little expected it, and as little thought to find me the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer of it to you; whom you have ſo much ſlighted: But know, this is the fruit of my long travels, and dangerous encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with this enemy: With whom I have endured a long and tedious warfare, with great expence of life and blood, even in my ſoul and ſpirit; and have received many deſperate wounds in my inward man: while you lived at caſe, and in pleaſure, both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward: You now have that cheap, which coſt me dear: For alas, how much eaſier it is for you, to receive this conviction, from the hand of a weak broken man, in love and compaſſion to you: Then to receive it, as I have done, from an angry and jealous God? How much eaſier, is it for you, to bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof from the experience of a friend? then to conflict with this deſtroyer, hand to hand, and to graple with all his malice, darkneſs and wrath, in your own naked ſouls and ſpirits? which God knows I have done, again and again: I know you have had ſtrange thoughts of me, I forgive you; you might well think ſtrangely of me, when you beheld me encompaſſed with the darkneſs and ſmoak of this bottomleſs pit: and ſenſibly loſt and ſwallowed up by this enemy: But I
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41851:121"/>have by the mighty power and goodneſs of God, eſcaped thorow many deaths and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and yet live to communicate to you the benefit of my conflicts, ſufferings and deliverance.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, you intend not war and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them which you oppoſe, but their repentance: See that you be true to this: I do believe many are wholly taken off from war, by the great experience we have had, of the beaſtly deceit, the horrible cruelty and corruption that hath attended it: And that the ſame honeſty that led them out at firſt to engage in it, leads them now to abhor it, and to chuſe rather to ſuffer, then by war to ſeek a deliverance: For the clearing and ſtrengthening their ſpirits, in that way of peace, are theſe things writ: And to inform and inſtruct others, that are yet uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</p>
               <p>We will then ſuppoſe, that you intend not to get liberty of Conſcience by violence and war; which was our firſt branch, but by a friendly agreement, with the preſent: Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Governours; this is our ſecond branch.</p>
               <p>If we deſire liberty, firſt know, That it muſt be from the Magiſtrate; for all liberty, Civil and Spiritual, is in his power, either to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41851:122"/>give or reſtrain: Liberty is the fruit that grows only upon the tree of Government, Law and Authority; or is enjoyed only under the protection of them: Take away Authority and Magiſtracy, and all kind of liberty ceaſes; we are preſently expoſed to the luſts of wilde and brutiſh men: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that are truly conſcientious, are moſt faithful to Magiſtracy: 1. Becauſe they are bound to obey, not only <hi>for wrath,</hi> as others, <hi>but for conſcience ſake;</hi> in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, who hath inſtituted Magiſtracy, and ordained that power: And they know and feel the Providence and goodneſs of God, in the Magiſtrate, as well as the weight of his Scepter: 2. Becauſe they may receive more benefit from him, then others; liberty, not only for their outward man, but for their ſpiritual man alſo; which others need not: 3. Becauſe they being conſcientious, are more tender then others, and ſo more ſubject to injury, then thoſe that are not bound by conſcience: The looſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, need the Magiſtrate, to reſtrain and ſubdue their wills; the conſcientious, is his own Law, as to reſtraint, and needs the Magiſtrate only for his protection: So that indeed the ſword of Authority, if rightly underſtood, the edge of it is againſt the looſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41851:122"/>and lawleſs life, and the peace and favour of it, is to the good and the godly.</p>
               <p>The enemy of man, and author of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, hath brought forth much miſchief amongſt us; both to the Magiſtrate, and to the conſcientious; in dividing one from the other; and ſetting of them againſt each other, which have but one root: For the Magiſtrate <hi>is the Miniſter of God for good, Rom.</hi> 13.4. And conſcience binds a man to ſubject to all the words and works of God; and to all things that are adminiſtred from him or by him: Upon a little ſober conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, this miſt of errour and miſtake will be ſcattered.</p>
               <p>But if the Magiſtrate give us this liberty of Conſcience; then in reaſon and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we are bound to defend the Magiſtrate, that defends us in this liberty: And if we deſire liberty of him, it is but equal and reaſonable, that we ſhould profeſs, that it is our judgements and conſciences ſo to do: For we cannot expect he ſhould give liberty to a conſcience, that would deſtroy him and his Government. Wherefore <hi>when men have profeſſed conſcience, in deſtroying and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Governments, there ſhould be a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Profeſſion againſt it, anſwerable to the evil done by it; or ſufficient to wipe off that ſcandal.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:41851:123"/>
               <p>Secondly, If we deſire <hi>liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> from the Magiſtrate, it muſt be either, in a way of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>both;</hi> if we ſeek it from him in a way of <hi>reaſon,</hi> we muſt admit him <hi>a man, a reaſonable creature,</hi> elſe it is in vain to ſeek <hi>reaſon</hi> of him: If the Magiſtrate be <hi>man,</hi> he hath the image of God as <hi>man,</hi> and as <hi>Magiſtrate;</hi> which is to be beloved, honoured, and defended by us; not oppoſed, hated and deſtroyed: If there be <hi>man</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> it is poſſible and likely we may agree with and unite to <hi>man;</hi> becauſe we alſo are men of the ſame fleſh and blood with him, and he with us: If we do not agree with our own <hi>nature,</hi> though under many defects, there is ſomething <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> in us; which we may call Spiritual, but if it be Spiritual, it is not divine nor Chriſtian; for God loves <hi>man,</hi> is reconciled to <hi>man,</hi> Chriſt is a <hi>man,</hi> and loves his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: If we confeſs them to be men, then we are to deal humanely with them, and to exerciſe reaſon to them, openly, clearly, fairly: If we think they err, we are in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to go to them, and to inform them if we can, or to receive information from them: If we need anything of them, we ſhould reaſonably propound our requeſt to them: If both parties be men, and will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41851:123"/>reaſon to each other, there will be an underſtanding and agreement; for there is but one reaſon in all men.</p>
               <p>If we ſeek <hi>liberty of Conſcience,</hi> upon grounds of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> which is moſt proper, and moſt for the advantage of the Cauſe of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> who hath moſt ſtrength in his own Court; then we muſt conclude the Magiſtrate hath a Conſcience: For if he have no conſcience, he cannot conſider conſcience to give it freedom: If the Magiſtrate have a conſcience, then, 1. If we plead liberty of Conſcience, he muſt be himſelf <hi>free,</hi> to exerciſe that <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> in Religion and Worſhip: Can you then freely grant that to the Magiſtrate, which you deſire of him? And let him in his way be as free from your tongues and pens, as you deſire to be from his ſword and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: If ſo, then you muſt ceaſe all rayling, reviling and reproaching; for that, from the ſubject to the Magiſtrate, is perſecution of the tongue, in name and dignity; as well impriſonment, from the Magiſtrate to the ſubject, is perſecution of the body.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But ought we not to reprove evil, and teſtifie againſt it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea according to the Goſpel; which is to reprove them as Brethren, with
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41851:124"/>meekneſs, long-ſuffering, love, gentleneſs; but to ſpeak evil of their perſons and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; not to them, but to others againſt them; is not to convince, but to defame, which to a dignity is to oppoſe, and ſo to overthrow it, and to ſet up your ſelves either againſt or above them: If ſo, you go beyond a Goſpel-rule, which forbids to <hi>ſpeak evil of dignities,</hi> and commands <hi>to honour all men:</hi> If it be not according to the Goſpel of Peace and Love, then it is carnal ſtrife, and will bring forth fruits accordingly: And will ſtir up anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſaffection in the Magiſtrate: For him to reſtrain and impriſon, is the ſame thing, with your oppoſing them, whereby you would reſtrain them, from ſetting up or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing what their conſciences lead them to.</p>
               <p>Obſerve this well, If you expect <hi>liberty of Conſcience to worſhip,</hi> you muſt give <hi>liberty of Conſcience to worſhip:</hi> And they that have liberty, to worſhip God in Jeſus Chriſt, are part of his <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Church:</hi> If you and others will admit this, <hi>That men walking in different wayes of worſhip, of one God, are all ſervants of that God, whom they worſhip, and ſo members of the body and of the Church, though under much darkneſs &amp; many miſtakes;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:41851:124"/>
               <p>To enlarge your minds to this; do but conſider, that which both your reaſon and your wants, will neceſſarily lead you to: For can you ask liberty of Conſcience, of them that have no Conſcience? If they have Conſcience, they muſt have liberty to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God: If they be worſhippers of God in the name of Chriſt, they are Chriſtians: And this they do; therefore they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with us, though dead or corrupt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>And as our reaſon and wants will lead us to it, ſo our judgements may well admit it: For the body of Chriſt, is this day moſt large; and the Houſe of God, is <hi>a Houſe of prayer to all Nations:</hi> The name of Jeſus Chriſt, is publiſhed, received, and <hi>believed on in the world,</hi> and conſequently called upon: And <hi>all that call upon the name of the Lord are ſaved;</hi> that is, according to the degree or meaſure of Faith, Religion, Obedience and Worſhip they exerciſe, ſo is their ſalvation; either outward, temporary and worldly, or inward, ſpiritual and eternal: For we plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee that all men do worſhip God, and have ſome kind of Communion with him; They give him ſome ſervice, and receive ſome good from him; life, and ſupport, for that life, for the ſoul and body: Which doth not
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41851:125"/>deny the exerciſe of juſtice, either to God or men; neither of temporary or eternal, civil or eccleſiaſtical; but eſtabliſhes all: For by admitting all, to this common priviledge, they are thereby ſubject to all divine, chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and humane judgements.</p>
               <p>And either we muſt admit all Parties to this priviledge, or elſe we muſt admit them to no outward, civil or natural priviledge: For the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> and viſible <hi>body of Chriſt,</hi> is more large then any Nation; and the love of God to man, in Chriſt, is larger then any other law or light, civil or natural: The Spirit of Jeſus is more merciful, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering and gentle, then any other ſpirit: And therefore if we cannot admit them, to be partakers of Gods goodneſs in his Houſe, we ſhall not allow them a place in the earth.</p>
               <p>And they that pray againſt men, as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, as wicked and Antichriſtian; they will alſo thruſt them out of all rule and dominion; and conſequently, out of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in the earth; and either deſtroy them quite, or reduce them to ſlavery: If this be conſidered, it is ſo vile a thing, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man will abhor it: And if it abhor the effect, it muſt alſo abhor the cauſe; that <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>way,</hi> that produces ſuch cruel things in the earth.</p>

               <p>And as it is vile in it ſelf, ſo it engages Party againſt Party, to their utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and leaves no means of peace; which is moſt contrary, to all the grace of God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It further follows, if we allow the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; we muſt allow him the Conſcience, not of a <hi>private perſon</hi> only, but of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate:</hi> If he have freedom of Conſcience as a Magiſtrate, he hath not only liberty of worſhip; but liberty as a <hi>Magiſtrate;</hi> to countenance, advance and promote that worſhip which he practiſes, and judges to be the worſhip of God: For every one is bound, as to worſhip God, ſo to be zealous for that worſhip, and to promote it: And every one in their place doth it: <hi>Miniſters</hi> in their way, <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in their way, and <hi>People</hi> in their way.</p>
               <p>This then is the great difficulty, and the knot of the buſineſs, every Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires liberty, not only for their practiſe, but for their zeal, to promote their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way: This zeal wanting knowledge, and rule to walk by, and therefore in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; makes men claſh, oppoſe and quarrel one with another.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:41851:126"/>
               <p>It cannot be expected that I ſhould at this time ſhew, the place and duty of all degrees and Parties, with their diſtinct bounds and limits; it would require a Treatiſe by it ſelf: I ſhall only ſay this at preſent: 1. I know, there is a holy, righteous, and a good Law, for all men to walk by, in their ſeveral orders and places, in the great Houſe of God, without offence and hurt one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. There is work and employment for all, both <hi>Magiſtrates, Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> to exerciſe themſelves, and all the power committed to them, either <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> againſt the common enemy of mankind, wickedneſs, unrighteouſneſs and unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And the Church of God, and the Nation, have both <hi>need</hi> of all their power and gifts, and of every good thing, that God hath made; and <hi>right</hi> to them all. 3. While they oppoſe one another, the Church and Nation, doth not only loſe the benefit of all theſe parts; but envy, ſtrife confuſion, and ſo <hi>every evil work</hi> is encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the poor nature of man and the Church is neglected and ſpoyled. 4. As all theſe gifts and Ordinances of God, are the <hi>right of the Church,</hi> ſo they all come from one head, from Chriſt; <hi>of whom</hi> and <hi>by whom,</hi> are all powers, all gifts, Magiſtratical and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:41851:126"/>Miniſterial. 5. There is <hi>one law, one way,</hi> for them all, to employ all their power out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and gifts inward <hi>joyntly.</hi> 6. Herein only, can they all have comfort and honour, becauſe herein only they can do good, and live in love and peace: And therefore, laſtly it follows (which I ſhall ever preſs) <hi>There is a neceſſity of a friendly treaty and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Parties, of the ableſt, largeſt and wiſeſt of all Parties; to enquire for this excellent and perfect way and Law of God; which certainly, is compleat and ſufficient, and will be manifeſt, to them that ſeek it; and to this Church and Nation, if they ſeek it as a Church and Nation, that is, joyntly, all her parts and parties together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Till this can be obtained, or in order to this, let me deſire you to conſider; The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of zeal in promoting, every Party their way of worſhip, are viſibly theſe two: Firſt <hi>on the Magiſtrates part,</hi> by outward force and puniſhments, to compell mens conſciences to his way: This I hope is paſt and gone: We have the word of a King for it; and if we thankfully and humbly receive the favour of it, we may have it continued and confirmed: The ſecond is, <hi>on the gifted miniſtry or peoples ſide,</hi> their civil is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their way by anger, wrath and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41851:127"/>in preaching, praying, and writing: which are their weapons, as the Law and priſons are the Magiſtrates: And is the ſame evil in a finer and more ſpiritual way, and therefore laſt diſcovered, and laſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
               <p>If you ſhould not be invited to peace by the clemency and mercy of the King, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving liberty; yet you ought <hi>firſt</hi> to ceaſe from ſtrife, and to ſeek peace; becauſe you were laſt in war. 2. You are under puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it. 3. Your profeſſion and gifts are graater: You ſeem to be nearer the Goſpel, nearer to Chriſt, and therefore ſhould firſt lay down your weapons of wrath, and ſeek peace: You ſhould bear the evils and darkneſs, of them that you judge carnal and worldly. In doing ſo, you will have moſt peace, and honour, and ſooneſt find deliverance.</p>
               <p>I have been very large in this ſubject, much beyond the purpoſe of my mind, when I began to write: I know not well the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it: Since I have writ it, I am apt to think, there is need enough of it; I am not without fears, that the great diſcontent and unmortified zeal of ſome, will put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fooliſh and deſperate courſes, if more reaſon and religion do not bridle their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41851:127"/>Whether men are ſo mad or no, I know not, but this I am ſure, that this way of enmity and oppoſition, defiles and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes Religion: It feeds upon the peace and comfort of mens ſouls: It fills the Nation with jealouſies, and conſequently with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, diſtraction, and unſettledneſs: And is moſt prejudicial, to thoſe honeſt, holy things, that your hearts are engaged to and for.</p>
               <p>And therefore this is the concluſion of this matter; I deſire you and all men would take notice of it.</p>
               <p>That if you, or any men, have any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, for publick and Chriſtian good; Or any expectation of enjoying the bleſſing, favour and grace of God; either outward or inward, for ſoul or body; either for your ſelves, or for the Church of God: If you hope to have either peace in your ſouls, or peace and comfort in your places, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, families and relations: Then <hi>ceaſe from ſtrife, wrath and revenge:</hi> For they that live in this fire of <hi>wrath,</hi> it will certainly conſume them: For it is the diſpleaſure of God: And although you may be the <hi>rod</hi> in Gods hand, to chaſten and humble each other; yet the <hi>rod</hi> muſt to the <hi>fire:</hi> Ye may thrive and proſper in it a while, but its end is
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41851:128"/>to be deſtroyed: Ceaſe to be a <hi>rod,</hi> ceaſe to officiate under that great enemy of Chriſt, of man, and of peace, the deſtroyer.</p>
               <p>Be warned by my experience: And <hi>know all men, That whatever you adminiſter to others, ſhall be adminiſtred to you: With what judgement you judge, ye ſhall be judged: and what meaſure you mete, ſhall be meaſured to you again; If you trouble and vex others, you ſhall be vexed and troubled: If you cenſure and judge to hell, you muſt come to feel it your ſelves: All the evil that I have ſpoken againſt any, even the worſt of it, I have born it my ſelf; and bleſs God for it: Therefore if the ſame righteous God judge you, as he hath done me, by the ſame Law and Word of Chriſt, as I know he will, in ſome degree or other. Then you muſt ſuffer upon your own ſouls, all thoſe plagues and curſes, that you denounce againſt your brethren, as Antichriſtian, as wicked and ungodly men: God did not ſpare his Son, but laid upon him that hell, and curſe, and thoſe woes, that he threatned againſt his enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know but one of theſe two wayes of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring the Law and Judgements of God: <hi>Either we muſt be ſuch, as are indeed one with them, and ſo love them, and be willing our ſelves to ſuffer them: Or elſe ſuch as do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41851:128"/>the ſame to others, which God hath firſt adminiſtred upon us; and do it, with the ſame love and mercy, wherein he hath done it to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if we eaſe our ſelves, call off the curſe and judgement to others, and load others, to free our ſelves: This is contrary to Chriſt: and therefore it ſhall not ſtand: For, 1. That life that ſo doth, is not a true Chriſtian life; and therefore the curſe that goes out from him, will return to him. And 2. That againſt which the curſe goes out, may bear it awhile; but there is ſomething alſo that is to be ſaved, though thorow ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; and therefore that curſe or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is diſcharged by any man, at another; when that good that is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom ariſes, and comes forth, it will repell that curſe, and then it returns to him from whence it came: For an evil or curſe, once born, muſt reſt ſomewhere; therefore if it find not reſt, it will return to the firſt author of it.</p>
               <p>All ſides muſt conſider this, There is in your enemies, the Royal Party, a Law, an Ordinance of God, a Providence, a humane nature, which is of God, and though it lie in much weakneſs, it will ſtand as a rock: And therefore all the arrows ſhot againſt
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41851:129"/>them, in paſſion and anger, will certainly recoil and wound the archers: And there is in you that now ſuffer, an innocency, an honeſty, though under much errour and miſtake; and therefore the wrath and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge adminiſtred againſt you, will return upon the ſouls, families and affairs of them that perſecute you.</p>
               <p>The reaſon and experience of theſe things, brings that notable Scripture to my mind, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.16, &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe he remembred not to ſhew mercy, but perſecuted the poor and needy man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As he loved curſing, ſo let it come unto him: As he delighted not in bleſſing, ſo let it be far from: As he cloathed himſelf with curſing, as with a garment, ſo let it come into his bowels like water, and like oyl into his bones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let this be the reward of mine Adverſaries,</hi> &amp;c. (Of the adverſaries of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Lamb of God</hi>) of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the beaſt</hi> and the <hi>falſe Prophet:</hi> And of all that Kingdom of darkneſs; let that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Kingdom, ſink from <hi>man</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> into its own place; let all curſing fall as water, <hi>into thoſe bowels of hell,</hi> from whence they came; and ſo be ſwallowed up, by him that firſt brought them forth: The Spirit of Chriſt, that ſaid this in <hi>David,</hi> will 1. Do it himſelf, he will take the curſe upon himſelf,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41851:129"/>and ſwallow it, and hell and death into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. And 2. will require it of others to do it; and will by his own power enable them to do it, or do it in them and for them: And thereby <hi>deſtroy</hi> him that hath <hi>deſtroyed</hi> the earth.</p>
               <p>If we underſtand his holy and good will, we ſhall all learn to bear and digeſt the curſe, and not inflict it: According to that moſt excellent rule, <hi>Bleſs them that perſecute you, bleſs, and curſe not, Rom</hi> 12.14. Learn this, bleſs, and <hi>curſe not;</hi> no not the worſt, not perſecutors; not them that perſecute the Saints. None but Saints can learn this; none are true Saints, but ſuch as do learn it: The perſecutors of the Saints, muſt be bleſſed by the Saints; by an holy, true, juſt, righteous mind; not feignedly and deceitfully, but really and truly.</p>

               <p>You are now in affliction; which brings forth in you, a <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and a <hi>Profeſsion.</hi> 1. A <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> that you are juſtly and righteouſly puniſhed for your ſins. And 2. A <hi>Profeſsion</hi> of ſuffering for Chriſt, and as Martyrs to the truth: Theſe two are very wide in their natures, ſuffering <hi>for ſin,</hi> and ſuffering <hi>for Chriſt:</hi> And therefore you ſhould do well to conſider, how they come to meet together in your preſent ſtate.</p>
               <p>It is plain and viſible to all men, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe now to your ſelves, that <hi>Babel</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, hath been in, and upon all your wars,

               <p>The ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>his body,</hi> which did all conform to him their head, were of this nature: Firſt, they ſuffered voluntarily, they <hi>offered</hi> themſelves <hi>a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> willingly and chearfully; and not by conſtraint or neceſſity: They did not firſt reſiſt, oppoſe, war, and ſuppreſs others, and then ſuffer, when they could fight no longer. Secondly, They were innocent as <hi>Lambs,</hi> never attempted any evil upon any people. Thirdly, They loved their enemies, and prayed for them; Chriſt began, <hi>Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, they know not what they do:</hi> the firſt that followed him, Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> did the like, <hi>Lord lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi> And ſo the reſt: And this, in <hi>faith</hi> and in <hi>truth,</hi> which made it effectual: They were very far from deſigning the ruine of their enemies. Fourthly, They ſuffered all for one cauſe, for <hi>the Kingdom and patience of Jeſus:</hi> to witneſs, that this was the way to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: That as Chriſt <hi>died</hi> and <hi>roſe again,</hi> ſo they ſhould likewiſe riſe, and <hi>raign</hi> with him, if they <hi>ſuffered</hi> with him: I could ſay more, but I forbear: Conſider your ſelves, and compare your preſent ſufferings with his and the Saints of old.</p>
               <p>If you do profeſs the Croſs of Chriſt, and to ſuffer with him, do you not then deſert,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41851:132"/>either all, or the chief of thoſe things you call principles, upon which you engaged: Is not this contray to fighting for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or for the liberties of the people? Is it not contrary, to your taking up the ſword; and to your right of conqueſt by the ſword, to raigning and ruling by force? They are ſurely moſt contrary; and therefore, Chriſt knowing he was to ſuffer, commanded <hi>Peter</hi> to put up his ſword, and gave this rule for ever: <hi>He that taketh up the ſword</hi> (to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf from ſuffering, or to fight for Chriſt) <hi>ſhall periſh by the ſword.</hi> Note, 1. We took up the ſword at firſt to avoid ſuffering, and to deliver our ſelves and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 2. We now periſh by that ſword, 3. If we now begin to learn, what we then refuſed, we go back and repent of all theſe twenty years work: We may I think well do it, as it was our work; and therein juſtifie both the righteouſneſs of <hi>God</hi> in his works, and our <hi>honeſty</hi> and <hi>innocency</hi> in ſerving of him.</p>
               <p>This your <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of ſuffering for Chriſt; will I think overthrow all your <hi>active diſpenſation,</hi> and if you be true to it, it will lead you to an open declaration, of the change of your minds, and to a faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution wholly to <hi>commit your cauſe to God,</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:41851:132"/>and never more take up arms to deliver your ſelves, and deſtroy others: If you can do this; pluck up <hi>this root of bitterneſs,</hi> and cut out <hi>this core,</hi> it will be a great eaſe, both to your ſelves and the Nation: If you are able to pull it up, and remove it from you, by a full, honeſt and clear demonſtration of your hearts and minds, that may be ſufficient to ſatisfie the Magiſtrate: It will effect one of theſe two things; Either it will overcome your enemies with love, and ſo heal all the diſtractions of the Nation; Or if they continue to perſecute, after ſuch a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your minds, they will ſoon break themſelves: For by love and patience, Chriſt hath and doth overcome all enmity, and will do ſo for ever; it is the moſt certain and invincible ſtrength that ever was.</p>
               <p>When you proſecuted the King and his Party, <hi>beyond bounds and meaſure,</hi> you went into <hi>confuſion;</hi> and there loſt your ſelves: And if they ſhould be guilty of the ſame thing, and purſue a weak, faln people, beyond the meaſure ſet by God; the ſame <hi>confuſion,</hi> will be in their affairs, that was in yours.</p>
               <p>I think this of your preſent ſufferings: That in a large and common ſenſe, they are
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41851:133"/>the ſufferings of Chriſt; as the ſufferings of all men are his, ſo far as they are humane, though weak: <hi>In all their afflictions he is afflicted:</hi> The ſins and ſufferings of all are laid upon him: <hi>We all like ſheep have gone aſtray, and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquities of us all;</hi> and as our ſins, ſo our ſorrows: <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows:</hi> Even of all Parties, and of the worſt of all, not the godly only, but the wicked; not the obedient only, but the rebells: <hi>He made his grave with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: Even for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell amongst them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore we do ſee, that all Parties are enabled to ſuffer for that Cauſe they engage in: And do find mercy to pardon their ſins, and ſtrength to ſuffer death: The common reſolution of a man, ſtrengthened with the common grace of the Goſpel, and with any meaſure of common honeſty, or an opinion of the juſtice and truth of their cauſe, do carry men off the ſtage of the world, into death, handſomly and ſteadily: That ſome of you, that have ſuffered, have met with more peace, and more innocency, in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then in acting: And more love, and comfort, in a priſon and death, then in a corrupt, toylſom, and ſinful life, in war and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41851:133"/>conteſts; I do not wonder, and yet cannot magnifie it as Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>This I am bold to affirm; That Chriſt hath not yet in theſe times, ſo clearly or viſibly ſet up his ſtandard, and gathered a people to it, into diſtinction from other men; as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his name, truth, and croſs, wholly and only to them: Nor hath he formed a body, by any law, rule, ſpirit, or miniſtry, into an outward profeſſion, under any viſible char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as he did in the Primitive times: And therefore there are none, whoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings can challenge this peculiar honour, of fighting under this ſtandard, the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I do much fear, that this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion,</hi> and <hi>glorying in the Croſs,</hi> will coſt you dear, and involve you in deeper ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, then you are aware of: You will ſooner come to a true feeling of your ſelves, and a ſober ſenſe of your condition, if you would ſink down into your <hi>confeſsion,</hi> and acknowledgement of the righteous hand of God upon you for your ſins: And alas, not ſo much for your <hi>perſonal</hi> ſins, as for the <hi>evil ſtate</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> in which you have acted: Againſt it hath God very great indignation: I feel in my ſoul, God hath great pitty to your perſons as men, and as his creatures
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41851:134"/>and ſervants: And becauſe as weak men, you have been deceived and miſled: But that corrupt ſtate, and that ſpirit that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you, is judged for ever, and never can, nor ſhall recover.</p>
               <p>It is not the lowneſs of a condition, that keeps a people down; but the unſoundneſs of it: Were we once true and ſingle, we ſhould find reſt and peace, in the worſt things, and deliverance out of them: The upright may and ſhall rejoyce, in the hotteſt fires, and ſoon come forth: But a falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound ſtate, muſt fall from heaven, though it be exalted thither.</p>
               <p>To fall under ſin and ſhame; to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under the feet of the vileſt creatures in the world; to bear, firſt our own ſins, and then the wrath, ſcorn, and revenge of all the world: Is nearer to Chriſt, ſhews more of innocency then t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>If there ſhould be none of all this in your preſent ſufferings, yet ſo long, as there <hi>is bitter envying, and ſtrife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not againſt the truth,</hi> Jam. 3.14.

               <p>The rebuke of our Lord to his Diſciples, is proper for you; when they would have had <hi>fire from heaven to conſume their enemies,</hi> the Samaritans, becauſe they oppoſed them, in their way; it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.55. <hi>He turned and rebuked them, and ſaid, Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of:</hi> I am certain you know not, what ſpirit it is, that leads you in all this. Therefore as I have been and am againſt your actings; ſo I am againſt your ſufferings, not only becauſe they are impure and not evangelical; but becauſe I pi ty both you that ſuffer, and them that inflict them: I know the nature of man, and of Chriſt, is ſorely and grievouſly injured in both.

               <p>I Had now concluded with a propoſal for peace, had not this late Inſurrection drawn forth my mind, to a conſideration of it: Which although it be a very monſtrous and ſtrange thing, yet it doth ſo much agree, to what I have written in this Treatiſe, that I cannot but animadvert upon it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the nature and reaſon of it.</p>
               <p>I have largely diſcourſed of this ſpirit of wrath and oppoſition: And ſhewed the evil and danger of it: That if it be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the mind, and into Religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, in deprecating, curſing and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it will raign, and not be confined; but will break out into war and open hoſtility, in <hi>pag.</hi> 162, 163. theſe words are opened, <hi>Out of the Serpents root, comes forth a Cock trice, and his fruit is a fiery flying Serpent:</hi> The <hi>old Serpent,</hi> the Devil, is the root of all malice: from him and his ſpawn, comes forth this hiſſing <hi>Adder</hi> or <hi>Cockatrice,</hi> curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If this be hatched in Religion, and fed with zeal and holy duties, it will ſoon get wings, and flame forth, in attempts to war: This is, I think, a natural and true deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41851:136"/>on of this <hi>fiery flying Serpent,</hi> that flamed out and flew abroad in this late Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>It ſeems, while I was writing againſt it, the thing was hatching: I was by a ſecret ſpring in my mind, directed to write of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not only beyond my thoughts, when I began to write, but contrary to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of my ſoul; which did often turn away from the conſideration of ſuch black, dark, and helliſh ſpirits and practiſes: But though my mind be very averſe from taking pleaſure, in raking in ſuch filthy ſores, yet I could not reſiſt the power and juſtice of that reaſon, that led me into a diſcourſe of them: I ſee, <hi>there is a ſecret intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt reaſon, and the cauſes or principles of things: True underſtanding knows things, as fully in their cauſes, as ſenſe doth in their effects: There is nothing ſo deep or dark, but it is ſubject to be ſeen and over-ſeen, by the light of right reaſon: True reaſon is the image of God, and one with that ſupream wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that rules all things: And therefore will be juſtified and fulfilled, by him that is the head and Father of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I write not in the ſubtilty of wit, and Philoſophical obſervation, but in authority: And do require of all men, not only conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41851:136"/>of, but ſubjection to the righteouſneſs and truth of what is written: I know I am alone in what I write; and not only ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but ſomething ſtrange and different, from all mens preſent notion of things: I know alſo my perſon is mean and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible: Yet there is that juſtice, and truth of reaſon, in what I write, that I dare challenge, in the ſight of God and man, that it ſhould be conſidered.</p>
               <p>What is truly reaſonable or <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:41851:137"/>enlightened from, and in union with, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and eternal mind.</p>
               <p>I have ſome reaſon to urge this, becauſe in the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> I propoſed unto his Majeſty, and deſired a tryal of mens opinions, ſpirits and principles; by ſpiritual perſons, and by the Law of God and reaſon; As the only way of curing the diſtmpers of the Nation, which lie in the ſpirits and judgements of men: And are the roots, that bring forth theſe ill fruits, of rebellion: But it ſeems the propoſal I made, was either unſeaſonable, or otherwiſe ſo weak and obſcure, (I would blame none but my ſelf) that it was not conſidered, or if conſidered, it was rejected by his Majeſty: As it was neglected by his Majeſty, ſo the other ſide, did exceedingly ſcorn and revile it, and me for writing of it: Whatever weakneſs there be in the things there written, for which it may juſtly ſuffer, both neglect and contempt, yet there is that truth and reaſon in it, as will ſtand before God, and muſt be acknowledged by men: <hi>For what is reaſon and truth, agrees with the rule and Law of the moſt high God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt ſway and rule, all States and Kingdoms:</hi> And what is truth and reaſon, and ſo one with the eternal mind, will be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more true, or more evidently ſo, to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41851:137"/>morrow then to day: And conſequently that which refuſes it, will be found weaker and worſe by refuſing of it: I ſenſibly find that both Parties are farther from that great bleſſing of peace and happineſs, then they were before they refuſed it, and the Nation more diſturbed: Let us enquire into the reaſon on both ſides, and then poſſibly ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Propoſition of peace may find better acceptance: <hi>If reaſon be ſo weak, as not to prevail, it will be confirmed and ſtrengthened by experience:</hi> And ſo our loſſes will become our advantage, if we be made wiſe by our failings.</p>
               <p>Let us firſt obſerve the proceſs of things.</p>
               <p>After his Majeſties return, there was by the ſweetneſs and gentleneſs of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a great calmneſs and ſtilneſs in the Nation; and in a degree, in the moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite: The trying, condemning, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of the priſoners, for the death of his late Majeſty, ſtirred a new paſſion in the ſpirits of many people: And the execution, together with the reſolution of the ſufferers, revived a zeal, confidence, and boaſting of their cauſe, and an extraordinary earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their minds; which was expreſſed in inceſſant meetings, diſcourſes and prayers day and night: Theſe paſſions and religious
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41851:138"/>exerciſes, boyl up their minds, into new heats, which kindled this wild-fire, and at laſt blowed it up, into this open Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>That you may underſtand the reaſon of theſe things, let it be conſidered, what I have expreſſed in this and the former Treatiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God had <hi>a controverſie</hi> with this Church and Nation, becauſe of its ſins, and its ſinful ſtate and ſtanding; not with the things themſelves, only as they ſtood in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weakenſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God muſt have ſome to plead this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, with the Government and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of Church and State.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that he called forth for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he inſpires and impowers, with ſpirit for that work.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſeat and ſubject of this ſpirit, and miniſtry, is the judgements and conſciences of men: For men, by being inſpired, and led into opinions and judgements, contrary to the received Law of the Church, are thereby fitted to be inſtruments in Gods hand, of his diſpleaſure, to the Church: For the Church cannot be tried, but by ſuch ſpirits and judgements, which differ from it, and are contrary to it.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:41851:138"/>5. They that are thus impowered for ſuch a ſervice, ſo far as they do the will of the moſt high Lord in it, are to be owned and juſtified: Though the office be never ſo mean, and never ſo contrary to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he honours, wills and wayes of States and Kingdoms; yet it is the rod of God, and muſt be kiſſed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Theſe miniſters of this diſpleaſure, have tranſgreſſed, exceeded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore there is, in them that have exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted this diſpleaſure, and in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and work, ſomething that is juſt, and ſomething that is unjuſt and unrighteous: Till theſe are diſtinguiſhed, there is no right judgement of them.</p>
               <p>It muſt alſo be conſidered, and <hi>it is granted by all Divines, That the works of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Government, are executed, by the adminiſtration of Angels: Both the ſtanding and changing of Governments, is by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of theſe principalities and powers:</hi> Therefore in the great revolutions of this Kingdom, both good and bad Angels have been employed: They being ſpirits, their proper ſphere in which they move,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41851:139"/>is the ſpirits and conſciences of men.</p>
               <p>Therefore it follows, that as there hath been in theſe great Providences, a righteous work of God, and with it much unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; ſo there are, both Angels of light, and of darkneſs, inſpiring the minds and conſciences of men: Now to adminiſter juſtice upon men, that have acted in theſe things without any judgement made, of the principles and ſpirits, that have moved in them, cannot be thought to be perfect, nor a right way to cure our diſtractions: For outward puniſhments upon the body, will not remove the evils, that are planted by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the conſciences and judgements of men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For all men know: Firſt, That if there be but a little truth and uprightneſs, in any conſcience, it will bear up the perſon, in the greateſt outward ſuffering: Neither death, nor hell, are able to over-power, the leaſt grain of honeſty, in the pooreſt wretch that ever lived: That which is ſincere, is able to live and triumph under many ſins and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and will never yield till right be done to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mens ſpirits and conſciences, and the ſpirits that inſpire and lead them, are above the reach of the ſecular ſword, and only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:41851:139"/>to the Scepter of Chriſt, in his Church; to the ſword of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſcience, though erroneous and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, will enable men, to ſuffer bodily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, impriſonment and death, with great chearfulneſs: And if they are laid upon men, without the means of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they do harden men in errour.</p>
               <p>And therefore legal proceedings, only to bodily puniſhments, are not ſufficient reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to cure theſe diſtempers: The caſe of the Nation, under its preſent diſtempers, is certainly extraordinary, and far different from what it was an hundred or fifty years ſince: Great variety of ſpirits are gone forth, which have raiſed up the minds of men to a greater height of reaſon, religion and reſolution: And old ordinary reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, will not cure, new and extraordinary diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>If the Phyſick, be not proper to cure, and remove the diſeaſe, it will by ſtirring the humours, and enraging of them, make dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous commotions in the body.</p>
               <p>For if men, either from ſome meaſure of ſimplicity, be it in the leaſt degree, and much mixed; or from ſome ſpiritual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be it of what kind it will; or from an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous conſcience: If from any of theſe,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:41851:140"/>the ſufferer be able to repell the Sentence of the Judge, and to glory in his ſuffering, and in a ſhew of righteouſneſs, to triumph over death; he doth notably affront and wound that authority and judgement under which he ſuffers.</p>
               <p>A man and his cauſe when he comes to judgement, is brought out into the open view of all men, and not only made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but he and his cauſe, is exalted, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a conflict and tryal with the Law: If the Law comes forth, with that brightneſs and majeſty (that it ought) the man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in his own conſcience, and ſo juſtifies the Law, and ſubmits to his ſentence, and by this the Law and Authority is honoured: But if the perſon judged, ſtands clear in his own conſcience, upon any account, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits himſelf, in the face of dead) (when all men ordinarily yield) ſuch have a kind of conqueſt, and do ſeem to overcome the ſentence; which muſt needs have an effect upon the people.</p>
               <p>For people do naturally mind dying men, death is King of terrours, and it is a great thing to die, it raiſes men on high: And therefore in them that can die comfortably, and confidently, there is a great appearance of righteouſneſs and worth; which doth
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41851:140"/>much affect the minds of people; ſome are moved to pitty the ſufferer, and thereby his words and cauſe ſteals into their minds: Others are convinced, and drawn to the Party; Others are hardened and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it: For men think with themſelves, I cannot live comfortably, bur here is that which will make me able to die comfortably, and that is worth embracing.</p>
               <p>That which makes the Magiſtrate to be feared and reverenced, is his power <hi>of life and death:</hi> That which makes men able to overcome death, ſecretly overcomes the Magiſtrate: For every one that goes out of the world glorying in his righteouſneſs, makes a breath, both in death, and in the authority that inflicts it: And when it comes to be eaſie and familiar, as it will by a little practiſe, Authority and Magiſtracy it ſelf will be, by ſuch deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall commend to the Magiſtrate an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of mine own, concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man: That he may conſider what he governs, and how he ought to govern him.</p>
               <p>Man is a noble and ſtout creature: There is ſo much of the majeſty of the image of God in faln man, that he retains much of the greatneſs, though he have loſt his goodneſs:
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:41851:141"/>There lies raked up in this duſt, an invincible ſpirit, that never will be ſubdued by force: God could never break the rebellion of the Iſraelites, by all his puniſhments upon them: And therefore ſayes, <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more, Iſa.</hi> 1.5. All the terrours of the Law, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſubject <hi>Paul,</hi> but he ſayes himſelf, <hi>When the commandment came, ſin revived, and I died, Rom.</hi> 7.9. When the law came, with terrour againſt him, then fin rouſed up it ſelf unto a deſperate oppoſition: There being ſuch ſtoutneſs in mans heart, that all the force of the <hi>Law</hi> could not ſubdue, God ſent his Son, in love to this ſtout creature, to take his fleſh, and ſo to ſoften and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it; and in it, to deſtroy both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>ſin:</hi> This will ſhew us what is in man.</p>
               <p>There is as much of this courage and greatneſs of ſpirit, in the Engliſh, as in any people under heaven; which is very much awakened in theſe times, both by the wars, and by long liberty, and a free exerciſe of their minds in Religion.</p>
               <p>For firſt, the people were inſpired and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered, to execute the determined diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, upon the Church and Nation, which exalted them, and ſubjected the Church and Nation under them: Having
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:41851:141"/>(as they think) judged the former ſtate of Religion, they have opportunity and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to erect ſeveral new forms of Religion, which is an act of ſpiritual principality and power, and not without zeal for God, and obedience to his Law: By theſe things, the genius of the Nation, and the natural ſtoutneſs of the people, is much lightened and encreaſed: And therefore to reduce them into that ſtate, that they think they have judged; and to deſtroy all their little principalities, ſet up in their conſciences; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by outward force, or by the meer letter of that Law, which they have condemned; without a ſuperiour Law, that judges them and their work, to my reaſon ſeems not only impoſſible, but dangerous.</p>
               <p>Let the whole be conſidered, and it will be found; That meer legal and outward puniſhments, upon ſuch a people, ſo ſpirited and principled, ſo employed and exerciſed; if their conſciences and ſpirits be nor firſt fairly heard, judged, and convinced, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame their minds into ſuch a mad and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſpirit, as appeared in the late Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into hardneſs and inſenſibility of death and danger; which is the greateſt enemy to Government that can be: For it turns men into wild beaſts, not to be ruled by humane
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:41851:142"/>Laws: And though they do attain nothing to themſelves, yet they may give diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and force the Magiſtrate from all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and divine wayes, of love and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, into violence and perpetual ſeverity; and fill the whole Nation with continual troubles and diſtractions.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Magiſtrate is bound by all bonds of Law, of reaſon and nature, to ſuppreſs and puniſh rebellion: But when the ſeeds of rebellion, lie in the mind and conſcience, the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſword is as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as the <hi>ſecular;</hi> and the one not effectual without the other: What is written in this Treatiſe, will I hope ſatisfie, them that will read and conſider, that there is with us, in the Church, a ſpirit and underſtanding, that will reach the root of rebellion in the mind, and fully convince the conſcience: Which being joyned to the civil authority, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to cure and heal the Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, I muſt deſire the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuffering Party, that were ſo highly offended at my Book, and at my propoſition for the tryal of principles, that they conſider how much lower they are now faln: There was certainly a loftineſs and unſubjection of mind, unſutable to their condition, expreſſed
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:41851:142"/>in a glorying and boaſting, of their old cauſe and ſtate, which hath brought forth this contempt and ſuffering upon them: I do believe, that this late Inſurrection, was the work of a few raſh and unreaſonable men: And do find, that all ſober men do expreſs a great abhorrency of the act, with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to wait patiently upon God for their deliverance: Which truly I rejoyce in: Yet the whole Party; lying under the ſhame of theſe mens folly and madneſs; they muſt ſeriouſly and deeply conſider, how far they yet ſtand, unhumbled, and unconvinced, of thoſe principles, that carried theſe men into this practiſe: Principles lie deep, and when once they get rooting in the mind, they are like ill weeds in a garden, not preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: Many times the judgement is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened againſt them; yet they have a root in the heart, which will ſpring up, if not quite eradicated: Their appearing in others, and the evil fruit they bear, is a good means to beget an utter deteſtation of them: To make you ſenſible of the hand of God upon you, and to help to clear your minds wholly of them, I only propound theſe queries to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Whether thoſe principles upon which they acted, of <hi>the Cauſe and Kingdom
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:41851:143"/>of Chriſt,</hi> and the honour and priviledge of <hi>the Saints,</hi> above and againſt the world: Have not been received into the minds and ſpirits of moſt men (more or leſs) that have erected new Churches, and new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in the Nation?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether the ſame principles, and the hopes of ſuch things, be not that which fills your heads and hearts, with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of prayers and great confidences, that you ſhall yet prevail, and your enemies be deſtroyed? And ſo though your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings be more prudent then others, yet whether the ſame things, be not yet in your faith, affections and duties?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether theſe ſpirits and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, have not had a great influence, upon the whole buſineſs a long time? If ſo, then if they be not rooted out, by repentance and change of mind, they lie not ſtill in the heart, though they ſeem not to act and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whether men being upon an <hi>extraordinary bottom,</hi> as the <hi>Saints of God,</hi> diſtinct from others; And exerciſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>extraordinary duties;</hi> with <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hopes</hi> and confidences, of <hi>extraordinary deliverances;</hi> Are not thereby diſpoſed and prepared to attempt <hi>extraordinary things,</hi>

They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to ſeck mixed wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Whether theſe high and great thoughts, upon future things, do not, 1. Lift up the mind, into an unſubjection unto this Providence of God, that layes you low, and exalts others? 2ly Alienate your minds from the preſent Government? 3ly Unſettle your ſpirits, to an unwillingneſs to peace? 4ly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny you the uſe of your reaſon for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſafety? 5ly And draw your minds from the preſent duties of love, forgiveneſs, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to authority, and to ſuch plain, honeſt things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I do hope, you do by experience ſee, how
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:41851:144"/>theſe high ſtrains, ſwelling the mind with ſpiritual pride, leads it into irrational and deſtructive wayes: It hath done ſo from the beginning, and doth ſo ſtill: My only end in this, is to improve this experience; to humble your minds, to take you off from theſe deluding ſpirits; And to bring you to a ſober ſenſe of your ſelves, and of the preſent ſtate of things: And to prepare you, for a rational and Chriſtian propoſition of peace, which I ſhall now commend to you, and to all the Nation.</p>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:41851:145"/>uſe of that <hi>common reaſon</hi> that all men par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of: And why <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> ſhould not have ſo much <hi>reaſon,</hi> as to underſtand one another, and <hi>agree</hi> together, I know not.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore take as clear a view, of the divided Parties as we can, and let both ſides be reaſonably conſidered: For it is the miſt and cloud about us, that confounds and diſturbs us.</p>
               <p>On the one ſide, there is <hi>his Majeſty,</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Clergy, and the people of the Nation: And with them Authority, Government, and Magiſtracy, both of Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, which are great <hi>Ordinances of God:</hi> And theſe ſtanding upon a firm, ſtable <hi>foundation of Law,</hi> deeply rooted, in time, cuſtom, and in the minds of people: And all now reſtored and exalted by a <hi>mighty Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and guarded, by the ſame hand that reſtored them.</p>
               <p>And therefore in reaſon; Firſt it is as <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible</hi> to remove them, as to extirpate the Engliſh Nation: Reaſon and experience confirm it: And ſecondly, it is an <hi>irrational</hi> and <hi>unſafe</hi> thing to attempt it: If it be <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational</hi> and <hi>unſafe</hi> to attempt it, it is not <hi>rational</hi> to think or imagine it: Nay, it is not honeſty or truth of mind, to fancy or think, what is in it ſelf unreaſonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:41851:146"/>practicable. If now mens minds depart from reaſon, into perſwaſions or conceits of things, upon a divine account, for which they have no certain, humane or ſpiritual ground, they will be deceived.</p>
               <p>But this ſtate of the Government is not repreſented only to deter from attempting upon it; but to gather your minds toward it: <hi>The reſt, ſafety, and comfort of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is in Law, Authority, and Government:</hi> This Government was of <hi>old,</hi> and is now <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored</hi> in the Nation: In it, is your ſafety, peace, and protection: It is there, and no where elſe, for you and all others: If you reaſonably and juſtly challenge it, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed it: If there ſhould be found an evil ſpirit of revenge, that ſhould refuſe to give it to you, being juſtly ſought: That evil ſpirit, ſhall be diſcovered, and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the ſpirit, not of the Government, nor Governors; but of ſome dark, envious, peeviſh minds: And it ſhall appear to be, as contrary and deſtructive to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Governors, as it is to your ſafety: Therefore the reaſon why you have not this peace and ſafety, is becauſe you fly from the Government, and ſo from your ſhelter and harbour; either ignorant of it; or jealous and fearful of it.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:41851:146"/>
               <p>This I think is a reaſonable account of one Party, I would now repreſent the other Party, as juſtly and rationally as I can: The many ſects that ſtand out againſt the preſent Government, at leaſt of the Church, are, together with the Presbyterians, who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in an oppoſition, a large people, a great part of the Nation: And very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, both for number, for their activity and reſolution; for their courage in military affairs; for their parts and abilities in civil affairs; for their zeal and gifts in Religion: And now being under <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, diſappointment and ſuffering, melting again into <hi>union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Law and Government of the one ſide, is ſo rooted in the earth, that it is not to be removed, by any humane means; ſo theſe ſeveral ſects are deeply rooted in the judgement and conſcience; and all of them are founded in ſome ſpirit, that hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God, over the conſcience; be that ſpirit or authority true or falſe, I diſpute not now: But they are, by ſome authority, under the name of God, fixed and bound in their ſeveral wayes: And therefore not poſſibly to be removed by any ſecular or worldly power.</p>
               <p>It is as irrational and impolitick, for a
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:41851:147"/>State, to ſeek by power, to ſuppreſs, or wholly to extirpate ſuch a people (fixed unto death, in their judgements) as it is for thoſe people to ſeek the overthrow of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Not only becauſe it is againſt policy, intereſt or reaſon of State, to diſcommon and caſt out of protection, or otherwiſe to provoke into deſpair, ſo great and mighty a people: But it is alſo againſt the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, and more againſt the nature and being of Government and Governors, to ſeek the ruine of ſo great a part of the body: and therefore it cannot be imagined to be in the Magiſtrate: Neither can the Magiſtrate entertain ſuch a thought, without committing a greater abſurdity, then for the common people to attempt the overthrow of the Kingdom: For the undertaking of impoſſible things, and things deſtructive to humane and civil peace, are much worſe in publick perſons, then in the people.</p>
               <p>But as on the other ſide, I repreſented the ſtate of the Government as immoveable, not only to deter from attempts againſt it, but to draw the people to it; that they might be protected by it: So do I repreſent theſe diſſatisfied and divided people, ſtrong and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, not only to diſſwade from deſigns againſt them, but alſo to encline the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:41851:147"/>to them: For as <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is by the Providence of God ordained in the hands of Governors and Government: ſo the ſame mighty Providence, hath diſpoſed the <hi>peace, reſt, ſecurity,</hi> and ſtrength of the Nation and Government, in the minds, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and ſpirits of ſuch a people: It will be eaſily ſeen and underſtood, if it be but conſidered; That there is this day, no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or viſible cauſe or danger of diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to the Nation, but our own diviſions; neither from our ſelves, nor from abroad: For as none can hurt us but our ſelves, ſo nothing amongſt our ſelves can hurt us, but our own diviſions.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as the <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the ſubject, is in the Law, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Magiſtrate; ſo the <hi>reſt, pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> and <hi>ſecurity,</hi> of the Government and Nation, is to be had, from a <hi>union,</hi> of ſuch a people, ſo divided and diſaffected as now they are.</p>
               <p>It is clear then, that each of theſe Parties, as they are now diſpoſed, are able to confer upon each other, and upon the whole, the moſt excellent bleſſings; On the one ſide, <hi>protection, ſafety,</hi> and ſubſiſtence; on the other ſide, <hi>ſecurity, reſt</hi> and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:41851:148"/>
               <p>Let us now conſider, Whether both theſe Parties are willing to give, and to receive theſe things from each other: For if both be willing, both to give and receive; then there is a foundation laid in them of peace.</p>
               <p>In reaſon, both Parties muſt be willing to have theſe great bleſſings, becauſe neither can ſubſiſt without them, or not comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt his Majeſty ſeeks ſecurity and peace, both by the impoſing the Oaths, which is but to oblige the people to quietneſs and obedience: And by reſtraining and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning, thoſe that may be ſuſpected, to make diſturbance: It is as manifeſt likewiſe, that he is willing to give ſafety, protection, and liberty to theſe people; witneſs his <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Declaration:</hi> But beyond all theſe, the reaſon of State, and nature of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, binds his Majeſty, to be willing, both to give ſafety, and receive ſecurity.</p>
               <p>The queſtion then is on the other ſide, Whether they are willing to give <hi>ſecurity,</hi> and receive <hi>protection:</hi> I think, it is not to be queſtioned, but that they will be glad of protection: And they cannot expect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, where they will not give reaſonable ſecurity for their Allegiance: As reaſon, nature and religion lead them to do it, ſo
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:41851:148"/>there doth appear, in moſt of them, a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do it, if they knew how to do it.</p>
               <p>Both Parties being willing to receive, and give theſe bleſſings, of <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>ſecurity</hi> to each other: It is then to be enquired, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any thing, in either Party, that may let or hinder them, from theſe mutual benefits? Two things may be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there may be ſome opinion or doctrine in Religion, that may imbondage mens minds, and keep them from yielding or receiving this good: I do hope and believe, that there is no opinion amongſt us, ſo inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and abſurd, as to debar us, from the exerciſe and practiſe of natural and civil du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: If any ſuch be whiſpered, or privately ſuggeſted, there is enough in every mans own reaſon, religion and nature, to teach him to abhor it: But if it ſhould be, in mens pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate fancies, I am ſure if it come forth in any debate, it will quickly be anſwered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: An open treaty or conference will expell it.</p>
               <p>Another thing that may hinder, is jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, prejudice, and enmity begotten by theſe wars, by the different forms of worſhip, and the oppoſite tempers of their minds and ſpirits: But theſe are all, a miſt or duſt,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:41851:149"/>which only darken at a diſtance: As ſoon as the Parties come near one another, their own natures and reaſons, together with the neceſſity and benefit of <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> will diſſipate theſe clouds: Being weak, dark paſſions, they will vaniſh before the ſtrength of more ſolid and ſubſtantial things.</p>
               <p>The lets being removed, there is no doubt of the ſufficiency of <hi>reaſon,</hi> to inſtruct both Parties in a way, how to communicate one with another, ſo that they ſhall be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, received and believed by each other: For if both Parties are heartily willing, to do that for each other, which is propoſed, they are able to ſay, <hi>how, why,</hi> and upon <hi>what conditions,</hi> they think reaſon to do it: And this being reaſonably propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reaſon alſo will accept it: For God never yet left man, ſo void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and knowledge one of another, nor ſo void of confidence, and truſt in one another, but they had power both to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and agree, and to gain belief and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence one in another: Though the envious man, hath filled the Nation with great enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diviſion, yet ſure we are men ſtill; he hath not rob'd us of our nature; there is ſtill with us, that reaſon, prudence, and faith, that is common with the moſt heatheniſh or barbarous Nations in the earth.</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:41851:149"/>
               <p>It may be thought rather, there is too much ſubtilty and policy, and that this may hinder an accord: There is more danger of it: But ſurely, if there be much Serpentine cunning, there is more true wiſdom; for the good, is ſtronger then the evil, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: I am ſure there is more light and ſtronger reaſon in love, then in hatred.</p>
               <p>Thus far we are gone; Two oppoſite Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Nation, both ſo firmly rooted in the earth and in heaven; that it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thing to think, that one ſhould remove the other by force, without deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole, and themſelves alſo: And theſe ſo conſiderable, that they may confer upon each other, the greateſt bleſſings that belong to humane ſociety: Both want, what each other have to give; neither can rationally have it elſewhere: Both willing to communicate, and able to communicate; The queſtion now is, how we ſhall begin, and how mannage this Treaty, ſo as to effect and perfect this diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>I have hinted in the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> that the divided Parties of this Nation are diſtinct bodies; The Presbyterian, Independant, Anabaptiſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are formed by diſtinct Laws and Doctrines: And have ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal men, that are their <hi>heads</hi> and <hi>leaders;</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:41851:150"/>theſe do comprehend their ſeveral Parties: (<hi>It was ill taken, that I ſhould mention them in my former:</hi> Alas, that divine juſtice, which my ſoul would have prevented, hath it ſelf now <hi>hunted</hi> them, and they are <hi>earthed</hi> now in holes) It is neceſſary that theſe ſhould ſtand forth for themſelves and Party, to treat for them, and to bring forth the principles and ſtate of the Party for them: Conſider <hi>now</hi> the equity and reaſon of this offer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, You that are the heads of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have led them into war, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into theſe miſeries, in which now they lie: And by your evil conduct, they and the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs have miſcarried: And therefore in reaſon and conſcience, you ought to appear for them: If there be any thing of courage, juſtice, or love to the people, or any thing of a publick ſpirit in <hi>you; you</hi> are bound to do the utmoſt you can, to deliver the poor ſheep out of theſe brambles, into which you have led them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch is the ſtate of things, that if there be any diſturbance made in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though you are not in it, yet you will be ever liable to be ſuſpected and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Till you have done ſomething towards peace, and ſecuring the Government, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:41851:150"/>to what you have formerly done againſt it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His Majeſty cannot have any rational ſecurity, either from particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or from broken pieces or Parties; but from the whole Party united; and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rationally done, but by them that are the heads of thoſe Parties, who do probably contain the whole Party in them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The people are certainly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, both to receive protection, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the preſent Providence of God: And therefore there wants nothing, but ſome prudent and publick perſons to form them, and lead them into it: And if there be compaſſion in you to them, as I believe there is, that will put you upon this honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Chriſtian work.</p>
               <p>We are now come, I think, by the conduct of honeſt and ſound reaſon, to the thing to be practiſed, which I hope is ſafe and juſt, and every way rational and Chriſtian; It is but this.</p>
               <p>If any two or three eminent and known men, of any Party, either from conviction of what is here written, or from their own diſpoſitions; and from a knowledge of the minds of their Party, or a probability of their conſent; ſhall be willing, in order to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:41851:151"/>their own ſafety, and the peace of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſatisfie <hi>his Majeſty</hi> concerning their intentions to live peaceably under <hi>his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi> Government; They may in a Petition humbly repreſent it to his Majeſty, and may beg, that his Majeſty would be pleaſed to appoint certain Commiſſioners, and impower them, to treat with them, and with all others that ſhall deſire it, concerning theſe two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Upon a full conſideration, of what hath paſſed in the Nation, what ſatisfaction or ſecurity his Majeſty may rationally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and they as rationally give, for their Allegiance, and peaceable ſubjection, unto his Majeſty and Government: and,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Upon ſatisfaction and ſecurity given, how that liberty of conſcience gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly declared by his Majeſty, may be ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed to them; that ſo they may enjoy the benefit and comfort of it free from diſturbance, from the people, or inferiour Officers.</p>
               <p>Both theſe are honeſt, reaſonable, and profitable things, and no man of truth or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity can be aſhamed, or afraid to appear in them publickly: They carry their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in their face.</p>
               <p>A Treaty betwixt oppoſite parties, after a
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:41851:151"/>long and great diviſion and war is <hi>ordinary:</hi> And if the difference be not only in affection, but judgement and opinion, it is <hi>neceſſary:</hi> becauſe otherwiſe, they cannot come to an underſtanding of one another, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently never come to a hearty agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>It is alſo probable, that the deſired end, peace and ſafety to both parties, will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by it: For it is apparent, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty wants and ſeeks ſecurity, and reſt in his Government, after his long troubles, an ſufferings: And after ſo great wars made againſt him, and ſo great violence done to him, he may juſtly require good ſecurity for the future: Nothing yet hath been done towards it, by the party that acted with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor againſt him: But on the contrary, have manifeſted great diſpleaſure and diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at his return to his Government.</p>
               <p>As his Majeſty cannot but ſeek ſecurity, ſo the ordinary old eſtabliſhed way of Oaths, enjoyned by Law, and the penalties annexed, ſeem to be very inſufficient remedies: For they have been found by ſad experience, too weak to bind men to their allegiance: Oaths, though they are ſacred in themſelves, yet we have found them very invalid in this Age, and ſtrangely violated on all ſides: If they are
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:41851:152"/>not ligaments ſufficiently ſtrong, to bind the parts together, and prevent a fraction; when the fraction is made, they are leſs able to heal it: Beſides at this time they are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to many, that are otherwiſe willing to give full ſecurity and ſatisfaction for their ſubjection.</p>
               <p>Neither can it be thought, that a bare verbal declaration for Magiſtracy, though it be honeſt, and ſo accepted; that it alone, ſhould be ſufficient to give full caſe to his Majeſties mind: Such confeſſions, I doubt are too weak to heal wounds made by long wars and diſaffections: To profeſs for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, is not a ſufficient ſatisfaction or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, for a war againſt a Magiſtrate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is an enemy, or of another way of worſhip: For the queſtion is not, nor never was, Whether a Magiſtrate or no: But there is an enmity begotten, and propagated by long war, which requires more then a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal profeſſion to heal it.</p>
               <p>That his Majeſty needs, and may juſtly require ſecurity, cannot be denied: That no means ſufficient, is yet uſed, is manifeſt: that the people are willing to do it, hath been proved; and that it is poſſible to do, in this caſe, what men are ready to do, is not to be queſtioned: That this means propounded,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:41851:152"/>by a Treaty is probable: It will appear, if we conſider, the advantage of a Treaty, both as to right underſtanding, removing objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and communicating affections, whereby ordinarily enmity is expelled, good will, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and agreement of hearts and minds is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; but beſides theſe generals, this main thing is to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>That in ſuch a Treaty, it will not be hard to bring forth the roots, ſeeds, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all the war and contention that hath been; and conſequently of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, in the Nation; and to offer them up to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The reaſon, why it will not be hard to do this, is becauſe: Firſt, The judgement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed upon the Church and Nation, is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, the miniſtry of wrath and war is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> The ſtate and ſpirit, in which, and by which it was adminiſtred, is corrupted, and by ſpiritual men, loathed and abhorred: 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> And conſequently, the enmity, at the root of it, is ſlain, though it ſtill diſturbs; yet in the hearts and judgements of ſober men, it hath received a deep and irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wound: Therefore it is very poſſible and eaſie, to produce the cauſe and reaſon of the late war, with the righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs of both ſides? And with it,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41851:153"/>all the ſeeds and principles of civil enmity, and diviſion, which may poſſibly beget any diſturbance for the future.</p>
               <p>If theſe roots of war, be pulled up, and ſacrificed, it will be the beſt <hi>bone-fire</hi> that ever was made in <hi>England:</hi> And will give the fulleſt ſatisfaction to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> that can be deſired: For by it his <hi>Majeſty</hi> will be ſecured of the hearts and minds of his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>If his <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſhall be pleaſed to anſwer ſuch a petition, and to appoint certain mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and underſtanding perſons, acceptable to theſe people, and ſo apt to entertain a Treaty with them; We may in reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that ſuch a door of ſafety being open, all parties will be glad to enter in at it: And if the chief of them can gather up the reſt of the people, into a conſent and agreement with them in this work; they will be able to offer a valuable conſideration, for their ſafety and protection: That may really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, both <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> alſo out of their purchaſes.</p>
               <p>If this be carried on by judgement and conſcience, and from a mind enlightened and convinced: We have no cauſe to fear, that it will not be underſtood, received and believed by his <hi>Majeſty:</hi> For what is done in light, is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:41851:153"/>evident to all: <hi>An Epiſtle ſeen and read of all men: When the mind is truly convinced, it is eaſie for it, to give forth ſuch a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it, as is ſufficient to convince another, that it is convinced:</hi> And ſuch a declaration coming from reaſon and from the heart; his <hi>Majeſties</hi> heart cannot but feel it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it: It being the only thing in the earth, wanting, to make his Government fully happy.</p>
               <p>Security being given, or ready to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by theſe people; the <hi>ſecond thing,</hi> their <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> comes naturally: Indeed it is already granted, and declared by his Majeſty, it only wants to be (by ſuch a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſome Articles) ſo explained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that the people may receive the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it.</p>
               <p>If theſe two things, which are truly and really conceived, in the hearts and natures of both ſides, may be brought forth; it will be a bleſſed foundation, of great good to the Nation and Church: And a preſent eaſe to the minds, of <hi>his Majeſty,</hi> and of his people; and will fill the whole Nation with pleaſure and content: For of all things, love and peace, have the greateſt felicity in them to a people: As diſcord betwixt brethren or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, is moſt grievous, ſo love that unites
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:41851:154"/>enemies is the moſt pleaſant and contentful: Such a meeting of hearts and minds in peace, will bring forth ſome more then ordinary good, to the Engliſh Nation; which are from their own diſpoſitions, inclined to love; and to an encreaſe of it, unto a kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, when once they begin.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Every battle of the warriour is with confuſed noiſe, and garments rolled in blood:</hi> Such yet is the ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of the Nation, confuſed <hi>noiſe</hi> there is, and <hi>garments rolled in blood:</hi> which do diſturb the minds of men, and makes them uncapable of the government and <hi>peace of Chriſts Kingdom:</hi> But if by this means propounded, a <hi>civil peace</hi> may be obtained; it will be a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and foundation, of a more heavenly and ſpiritual <hi>peace in the Church:</hi> It is true, this ſeems to be firſt neceſſary, but if this were obtained, I could demonſtrate the other as rational and poſſible as this, and more: Becauſe the <hi>Law and reaſon of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is more large, more forgiving, healing and uniting, then <hi>Civil Law or Reaſon: A union and peace in the Church, is promiſed and commanded in the Scripture: Nothing is promiſed that we may not challenge and expect; nothing commanded but what is practicable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Something I may affirm upon my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:41851:154"/>experience: For I have gone as far in the way of ſeparation, from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I think, as moſt men; and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted it as heartily: And yet my mind is now, and hath been long enlarged to own and embrace the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal government: I did not alter as a <hi>knave,</hi> as a <hi>fool,</hi> nor as an <hi>enemy,</hi> to them that differ from me: Not as a <hi>knave,</hi> for my mind altered, when Epiſcopacy was at low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and hath ſo continued ever ſince, in many troubles, without change: Nor as a <hi>fool,</hi> I confeſs I have received it from heaven, yet ſo as is fully demonſtrated to me, from reaſon and Scripture: Nor as <hi>enemy;</hi> For Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, as I underſtand it, is a tree ſo high and large, that all theſe birds, that now ſhe from it, may make their neſts in the branches of it, and be nouriſhed by the fruit of it: And that, not by clipping the outward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it; but by enlarging and exalting of it, into its own true heavenly light and glory. This I find and know by experience; what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſects, ſeek in their private and divided wayes, they ſhall never enjoy, but in the Church; there only they will find reſt for their ſouls: But theſe things ſhall reſt till their ſeaſon be to come forth.</p>
               <p>The thing that is here propounded to you,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:41851:155"/>that are my Brethren, and now in ſuffering; is ſo eſſentially neceſſary, in my judgement, for your ſafety, and the peace of the Nation; that if I knew any thing that might hinder you, from accepting and proſecuting it, as the means of your deliverance, I would remove it: There are but two things that I ſuſpect.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing I doubt, is leſt your high apprehenſions of ſome extraordinary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters promiſed in the Scriptures, and drunk into your thoughts, ſhould cauſe you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to your former oppoſition, and ſo divert you from the plain path of peace and ſafety: To anſwer you in this; Know 1. The things that you expect, both are, and will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted; and far more, and greater then you imagine. 2. But never to be obtained by enmity and wrath, but by love, peace, and by the good Spirit of Chriſt. 3. It is a falſe Prophet that holds forth greater and future things, to reſtrain from an exerciſe, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and plain duties. 4. I deſire you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and remember, that though theſe high ſtrains have got up into your prayers, and private diſcourſes, yet they never were of any power, in your great buſineſs: You will find, that the ſtrength of your cauſe, as it was urged by the Parliament, againſt the King; and the Army, againſt the Parliament;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:41851:155"/>lay in theſe low and common things, of <hi>ſafety, neceſsity,</hi> and the <hi>intereſt of the honeſt Party;</hi> and at the higheſt, <hi>providence</hi> and <hi>ſucceſs:</hi> Conſider now, Whether the ſame principles, do not now urge you to peace, that carried you to war? and more ſtrongly and juſtly?</p>
               <p>For <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>neceſsity,</hi> it is both ſeen and felt; that if you perſiſt in an oppoſition, to the preſent Government, you will ruine your ſelves and families; except a miracle appear for you: You have no true ground nor faith for miracles, if you have any, you may ſooner expect them in a Goſpel way, of peace, reconciliation and perſwaſion, then of war.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Providence,</hi> it now directs you to agree with his <hi>Majeſty:</hi> For the great <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of his reſtoration, hath eaten up, all your leſſer <hi>Providences;</hi> as <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, eat up the Egyptian Magicians rod: And all your <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> is now in the belly of this: If then, <hi>ſafety, neceſsity, intereſt</hi> and <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> could then lead you to make war; and the ſame things cannot now prevail with you, to ſeek peace; it will ſeem a dangerous and foul ſpirit: To delight in war, that is bloody and ſpoyling, unclean and filthy, and to decline the humble and meek way, of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:41851:156"/>and treaty, is not Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing I doubt, is your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the multitude, and earneſtneſs of your prayers: And to that, I propound the words of our Lord, which are of eternal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23, 24. <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembereſt, that thy Brother hath ought againſt thee; Leave there thy gift, before the Altar, and go thy way; firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift:</hi> The divine reaſon of it is this; God is the Lord and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all men, they are all his family; if any one of his children or ſervants, injure another, and the injured perſon cry to him, this cry comes up to him, and is there put in, as a bar or plea, againſt that mans prayers, till he make ſatisfaction: For God is juſt, and doth right to all men. Now you know, there is a cry gone up againſt you, for the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Nation: All Parties, as well as your adverſaries, have ſomething, yea much againſt you: And therefore, mark what I ſay, I ſpeak it as a <hi>Prieſt unto God,</hi> that do miniſter in his preſence; and as a <hi>Miniſter of the Word of Jeſus;</hi> till you can do theſe two things; Firſt, <hi>forgive your enemies,</hi> as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and truly, as you deſire God to forgive you. And ſecondly, <hi>ask forgiveneſs of them,</hi>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:41851:156"/>wherein they <hi>have ought againſt you.</hi> Till theſe two things be done, I put in a <hi>bar</hi> againſt all your prayers; were they ten thouſand times more then they are, they ſhall not prevail.</p>
               <p>Read but what follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 25, 26. <hi>Agree with thine adverſary quickly, while thou art in the way: Leſt at any time the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be caſt in priſon: Verily I ſay unto thee, thou ſhalt by no means come out thence, till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing:</hi> Your <hi>adverſary</hi> is your <hi>judge;</hi> the more reaſon to <hi>agree</hi> with him: You muſt either <hi>agree,</hi> &amp; compound, or <hi>ſtand it out:</hi> If you <hi>ſtand out,</hi> you muſt pay for all thoſe years of trouble and vexation, that <hi>you</hi> inflicted upon <hi>your</hi> enemies; for all the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ruine and deſtruction, <hi>you</hi> laid upon them and their families; <hi>If you ſtand upon your righteouſneſs, all muſt be paid to the utmoſt farthing:</hi> It is a great debt.</p>
               <p>Except by <hi>forgiving,</hi> and <hi>ſeeking forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> you agree; troubles and diſturbance, will offend the Nation; and then jealouſies, bonds and impriſonments will attend you: Till ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction be made for former injuries, to the laſt farthing.</p>
               <p>If you deſire peace and ſafety, read this
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:41851:157"/>laſt Section diligently, till you have made it your own: If you deſire either further ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or my aſſiſtance, I am ready to ſerve you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi>
